              <p>Before us is a door, and beyond that, the stage. On the stage is the dark red velvet curtain pulled shut, and on the other side, we know, is whatever is out there. I stand beside Mae in her chair. She seems to be chewing her lips.</p>
<p>"It'll be the time soon." I say to her. "Are you alright?"</p>
<p>"Not really." She turns to me, big green eyes full of anxiety. "Do I look appropriate?" She's in a white cashmere sweater and white woolen dress. She sits on the cushioned chair with only the pointed toes of her brown semi-combat boots touching the floor. She hates heels so there aren't any. I knew Ryan would puff out his chest and say, "She picked out everything herself!" Indeed she did. Her flame-red hair is tied, not in the hair bun her mother forces to wear all the time, but the crown braid the Lius fixed for her, which she loves.</p>

              <p>"We certainly weren't <em>this</em> loud when we were freshmen." Lily glances around the cafeteria. Wading through the chattering crowd with an empty stomach, only to find a rather cramped table for four in a corner is <em>not</em> her ideal first day of senior year in middle school. Her friends nod in agreement. "I wish it's still summer."</p>
<p>"Definitely not ready for school, no." Julia pulls an extra chair over.</p>
<p>"No kidding." Landon comes over with a slice of cheese cake, four cupcakes, and two big chunks of brownie. He hands on brownie to Max and tries to stuff the other into Julia's mouth, and gives the cupcake plate to Lily and Mae. "I guess especially you, Mae, since you missed most of it in the Treasure Trove."</p>

              <p>"Do you think he'll be home when we get back?" Lindsay asks behind the wheels. Cars glide through the streets of Kanten Av Skogen before her in the long Scandinavian winter night, the noise of their engines muffled by the thin mist flooding the town. Early Scandinavian winter brings an early evening; only a layer of glass keeps the chill at bay.</p>
<p>"He will. Don't worry. Charlie always comes back from his wanderings before six. He's smart even for a dog." William soothes her.</p>

              <p>Lao Wang woke to an infant dawn, hiding behind the curtains. Light snuck its way onto his wrinkled face through the gap, which he turned to his decade-old alarm clock first, then to the curtains, and finally to the metal heater at the foot of his bed. Dressing took him less than ten minutes: after his wife passed away almost two years ago, he had kept his clothes on the empty side of the bed instead of on the heater—a mere substitute of what was lost, even if it meant for him starting his winter days cold.</p>
<p>For the past two weeks, Lao Wang has broken out of his morning routine of curtains, bathroom, wash, and breakfast. He went straight to the foot of his bed, and squatted down to stroke Coco, his Chinese rural dog. The mud-yellow fur was stiff and the body was lukewarm. She slept on her side in the many-layered nest, breathing way too shallow for Lao Wang's liking. Coco hadn't moved much for two weeks and Lao Wang felt that it would be any day now. He went to pour milk into one of her bowls and filled up the other with chow.</p>

              <p>　　“别担心啦，我在另一头等你。”比利安慰道。“他们说什么你做什么就行，问什么就答什么。大多数情况下他们也就看一下你的护照和签证，然后也就没别的了。”</p>
<p>　　“他们能听懂我说的话吗？”艾瑞思四下看了看。海关大厅里挤满了人。大厅宽大明亮，人山人海。防护带把大厅一分为二，一边挤满了人，另一边被更多防护带围成了迷宫，两条队伍在里面缓布前行，围着一根柱子绕了一圈又一圈。柱子上的电视屏幕播放着一遍又一遍“准备好您的护照”和“如果您有需要申报的物品”之类的话。</p>
