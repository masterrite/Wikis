<p>Camilla didn’t make it.</p>
<p>Her condition had never improved. When she was taken in, she had been in a high fever. The medics managed to contain it just under 39°C with antibiotics and their elven arts. They also monitored her heart rate and brain activity, both of which remained at a bare minimum. In the 48 hours after her operations, her fever lowered, her heart had failed thrice, and each time they revived it, the charge used was greater than the last. Fifty-eight hours after her operations, her body temperature tumbled below 35°C. Medics rushed into action, only to find the infection within her body had resurged. The bacteria had adapted to their drugs with unexpected speed, and was already enough to inflame and disable her medulla. Sixty-one hours after her operations, her heart stopped, and defied all medical efforts. Sixty-one-and-a-half hours, she showed symptoms of hydrocephalus. The medics struggled for almost another two and a half hours before Iris, unable to sleep well, got dressed and waded to the medics tent through the dark. No one was in the hallway. She waited outside the emergency room, and listened to the muffled shuffle through the flap. She sat praying. No one was ever religious at the orphanage. Madam Yu didn’t allow it; she only believed in herself. The “Great Mother God” everyone swore to was a mere figure of speech. Whatever role she had in their folklore, she couldn’t help now.</p>

<p>"Hey. Can we cross?" Rubik came up to a Liberation Army soldier on the People's Boulevard, unfazed by his rough demeanor. "My sister and I need to get to the bank."</p>
<p>The last line of L.A.'s defense looked busier than Iris had expected. Soldiers in dirty shirts shoveled earth out of the trench that was as wide as the boulevard and extended further than their eyes could see both ways. It was already deep enough to hide a standing man. More warmly-dressed grunts chanted work calls while hauling heavy artillery vehicles up and down the its edge. Mechanics stretched half of their bodies under the line of parked tanks, their toolboxes poking out of the machines. Rubik and Iris weren't the only civilians outside today. Up and down the boulevard, more like them asked by the trench overpasses for access. The soldier held them both under scrutiny. His gaze lingered a bit too long on Rubik's face. He stepped aside and let them pass.</p>

<p>When they finally reached their street, Iris and Rubik were soaked. The water weighed down their gray and white cotton clothes. With every step Iris felt gross in her shoes. She had changed her hair to a ponytail, because the bun she had tied for keeping hair out of her face became just too heavy. The black waterfall of hair swung and tugged as she ran, so she clutched it to her chest.</p>
<p>The street was just like any other in the city: grey, rough, littered with puddles of mud and blood—aftermaths of a skirmish, one of many that plagued the city since the Civil War had begun 20 years ago, longer than Iris could ever remember.</p>
<p>“Rubik, is this really the time?” Iris called. She ran after him and reached out a ginger hand to pry him away from the bodies that lay scattered along the curb. Every day volunteers dragged new victims of war off the road, and every week they hauled them out of the city for burial. “Ugh.” Iris recoiled and backed under a building. Even the heavy rain couldn’t wash away the stench or the horrid expressions on their faces.</p>

<p><em>Beware when alone inside, lest the Phantoms lure you astray.</em> This is what they always say about the Forest. Every year people both local and foreign enter under its twilight canopy. Many walk out unscathed; a few are never found again; some come back, and tell the strangest stories, possible only in dreams, luring, almost like the Phantoms, more people inside.</p>
<p>Rich games, flourishing plants, scattering ruins---these the Forest held within its bosom along with who knows what other secrets, hiding and protecting them like a mother.</p>

<p><em>在里面一定要当心，慎防幽灵把你引走。</em>每当人们提起森林时，他们一定会说这句话。每年都会有人踏进幽深茂密的森林里，无论是当地人还是外来旅客。他们当中的大多数会毫发无损地出来，也有一小部分人进去之后便杳无音讯，还有一些人虽然回来了，却会讲述最匪夷所思的、梦境一般的故事。这些故事犹如幽灵，把更多的人引入森林。</p>
<p>肥美的野味、繁茂的植被、遍布的遗迹——这一切都和其他不为人知的秘密一同被森林揽入怀中，如同母亲一般藏匿与守护。</p>
<p>我们的母亲开车出收费站时，我的妹妹拽了拽我的袖子，悄声问我，我们在这里是不是真的没有问题。我同样悄声地否定，希望能安慰她——和自己。加上同行的另外两家人，我们一共十一个人，而不是一个。他们都说森林只根据一个人的渴望来制造幽灵，那如果我们一直待在一起，森林就不会知道应该参照谁的……吧？她握住我的手，因为紧张，我们两人的手冰凉。车外的春天沐浴在下午温暖明媚的阳光中，而车内的后排依旧残留着清晨的萧寒。</p>
