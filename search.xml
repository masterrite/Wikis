The water weighed down their gray and white cotton clothes. With every step Iris felt gross in her shoes. She had changed her hair to a ponytail, because the bun she had tied for keeping hair out of her face became just too heavy. The black waterfall of hair swung and tugged as she ran, so she clutched it to her chest.</p><p>The street was just like any other in the city: grey, rough, littered with puddles of mud and blood---aftermaths of a skirmish, one of many that plagued the city since the Civil War had begun 20 years ago, longer than Iris could ever remember.</p><p>"Rubik, is this really the time?" Iris called. She ran after him and reached out a ginger hand to pry him away from the bodies that lay scattered along the curb. Every day volunteers dragged new victims of war off the road, and every week they hauled them out of the city for burial. "Ugh." Iris recoiled and backed under a building. Even the heavy rain couldn't wash away the stench or the horrid expressions on their faces.</p><a id="more"></a><p>"Just a sec, babe. This one's new---" He patted down the body with deft fingers. They used to be street urchins before they were taken in. The war had torn their lives apart without a warning. Three days after her sixth birthday, the raid alarm sounded and Iris' parents shoved her into the cellar. It was Rubik and his grandmother from next door who let her out. Iris couldn't recall much after seeing her home in ruins around her. She <em>could</em> recall, however, how fast Rubik had picked up the bad habit of thieving. But then again, it was exactly that survival instinct that had kept them alive after his grandmother had died. All that remained of the habit was looting dead bodies after the orphanage happened. Rubik sighed. "Stripped clean. Ah well."</p><p>Thunder cracked overhead. Iris stifled a frightened squeal. Rubik leapt up and ran over. The rain was thick enough for him to wash the grime off his hands before pulling Iris into his arms.</p><p>"Boy! I squeezed water out of you!" He laughed. With Iris in one arm and their snakeskin bags of grocery secure on his back, he rushed down the street and whisked into a side road. <em>Pitpat pitpat</em> went the rain on the canopy above, like the marching of troops. Below the leaves, however, the path was dry. "We're home." He swept a thick wet lock of hair off of Iris' face. Another clasp of thunder and Iris flinched. He gave a swift check around and kissed her.</p><p>"It's okay - it's okay." He soothed. "Always wanna ask---what's so scary about thunder?"</p><p>"Reminds me of the cannons." Iris mumbled. They had seen those once too many when they were still in the suburbs. None had been inside the city, yet, thank Mother God. She set her hair loose and squeezed down along its length. Water poured by her feet. <em>Splat. Splat.</em></p><p>"There you are!" A rather plump girl of their age ran down the path, two umbrellas in hand. She was dressed in a dark navy dress. Under her leveled black fringes were eyes of disapproval, and the effect was enhanced by her tight bun, not a wisp of flyaway hair could be seen. "Madam Yu was starting to worry!" She grabbed Iris' hands. "Iris, you're soaked!"</p><p>"Hey, so am I! Gimme a share of care, too, yeah?" Rubik pressed his messy black hair and tilted his head to avoid the running water. A streak still slid down his thin face. He was starting to grow facial hair, Iris noticed. What would it become, those soft tufts? A mustache or a goatee?</p><p>"I saw what you did!" The girl hissed. "Spit it out, what else have you done to her?" They trudged back.</p><p>"Why are you always accusing me like that?" Rubik pulled a face, "and why do you always sound so eager?" The girl screwed up her face and poked an umbrella at him. He dodged, sniggering.</p><p>"It's okay, Anne." Iris pulled her friend to her other side, couldn't help smiling a bit. "It's okay."</p><p>"Humph." Anne clasped onto Iris' arm.</p><p>The side road curved and turned and opened to a yard surrounded by woods. Iris took a deep breath: the scent of damp soil was soothing. Trees---ginkgo and willow, mostly, but also plain old sycamore---dotted the yard. Laundry lines stood empty in the middle of the field to their right. Further than that were a small crop field and a playground. <em>No cleaning duties needed for the swings or the slides with this pouring rain, now.</em> Iris sighed inside.</p><p>The trees that had sheltered them so far stretched further along the path, all the way to the stone steps leading up to the red oak door of a mansion. The two-storied building spanned across the yard, its white stone walls almost glowed under the gray sky and against the muted green trees. Its roof was covered in solar panels. These were installed years ago to save money in the long run. Power was hard to come by in the war.</p><p>(<em>With this rain, the reservoir out in the woods would be full for a long while.</em>)</p><p>This hidden plot of paradise in the middle of the city was owned by a wealthy merchant family. Now, only the merchant's widow and a few servants remained. It had seen better days, but at least it was a decent home, to Iris, Anne, and Rubik, and 40 more orphans like them.</p><hr /><p>"---Good God, can you girls do nothing?" The head chef bawled as Iris, now dried, and another girl, Fay, failed to lift the cast iron pot together. "It's just a pot of soup! All water! Don't even have nothing inside!"</p><p>"Shall we thank you for your frugality, sir?" Rubik looked up from his chopping board, smirking. "You guys wanna switch?" He cleaned his hands and went over. The boy he teamed up with followed suit.</p><p>Iris and Fay took up the knives and set chopping. Girls at the orphanage hated back-of-house kitchen duties solely because of the head chef. He favored the boys, and never missed an opportunity to snap at the girls. Iris always felt an ominous vibe coming from him, and the older she grew, the stronger it became. The only woman he respected was the Matron, Madam Yu. He had to. She paid his wages.</p><p>"Misogynic creep." Fay muttered.</p><p>"<em>Misogynous</em>." Iris whispered.</p><p>"Whatever. Did you hear, Iris? What he said to Cam the other day?"</p><p>Iris frowned. The head chef picked on Camilla, one of the orphans who stayed as an assistant caretaker after her coming of age, more than on anyone else. Iris thought Cam pretty, but was too fussy with her. It wasn't until her sixteenth birthday that Cam told her how much Iris resembled her younger self, and thus the extra care.</p><p>"Mom should really fire him---"</p><p>"Spend your time <em>chopping</em> instead of <em>talking</em>!" The head chef growled from the stoves, banging the spatula on the wok. Iris suppressed a shutter as a flying bullet flashed across her mind. She bent her head and said nothing. "Girls," the head chef went on, "good for nothing but talking. You'd think you can send them onto the battlefield and they'd <em>talk</em> the enemy to death, but nope!"</p><p><em>It's not like you're out there fighting or anything.</em> Contemptuous, Iris chopped her cabbages with a tad more aggression than she had meant to.</p><p>"Great Mother God, how I want to kick him between his legs." Fay hissed. Iris stifled a snort.</p><p>"Uh... speaking of battlefields," a chef started, "the local butcher said the main force of the People's Army might be here soon. The Liberation Army is asking for more rations of late, and let slip that their reinforcements are coming in from the north. They're setting up heavier defenses, too."</p><p>"So they are fighting over this city?" Another asked.</p><p>"About damn time!" The head chef banged the wok again. "Five years before the Liberals remembered this city, and fifteen years of skirmishes before People's Party decided we're important enough for taking!"</p><p>"Where's their line of defense?" Fay piped up.</p><p>"Shut up, you---"</p><p>"Down south, People's Boulevard." The gruff chef behind them cut across the head chef. The girls gaped at him. That wasn't too far away. People's Boulevard was the main street that cut the city in half east to west, four blocks from theirs. The Liberation Army camp was three more blocks up north. "You girls be careful heading out, yeah? If it's true, there'll be more skirmishes around this part."</p><p>"They're also bringing in tanks and mortars and stuff." A younger chef nodded solemnly. "Might come tomorrow, or a week later. Who knows."</p><p>"That's life now." Fay mumbled. "Why can't they just kill each other and settle the score here for good."</p><p>Iris made a non-committal grunt. She could never figure out which side she should be supporting. Neither side seemed alright. What was the L.A. liberating them from? If the P.A. was for the people, why was there a war ruining people's life in the first place? She never bothered asking. What could she do about the war, anyways.</p><p>The dining hall was wide and well-lit. Three rows of table ran along the length of the chamber below the chandeliers. The wall had ebony planks along its bottom third. The wallpaper was a fabric of floral patterns. High upon the wall were framed sepia photos of each orphan's birthday. A long table laden with trays of food and pots of soup was at the front, where Iris and her duty partners stood waiting for Madam Yu's signal. Iris always thought Madam Yu looked haughty, shrewd, and strict. Steely eyes, high cheekbones, a sharp nose, and pursed lips, Madam Yu was indeed all those, as well as much, much more. Her hands, growing rougher every year, were the ones Iris would think of when she thought of the phrase, "mother's hands". Now Madam Yu raised them both and, with an affirmative smile, gave the children by the tables a brisk beckon and a firm nod. There was a flurry of shuffles and wooden bench scraping the wooden floor, and one by one, children from four-year-olds waddling beside the older ones who led them on to sixteen-year-olds flipping and twirling their plate in their hands, all in hand-sewn cotton clothes, lined up in the front of the hall.</p><p>Madam Yu steadied each of their wares with one hand and cut into the rice with a spatula with the other, greeting them and asking, "Less or more?" She made occasional comments, or gave a child a loving tap on the nose, or cracked passing jokes with the older ones. Every child present was picked off the streets by her. She tried to give what had been taken from them: food, shelter, clothes, and love---a childhood. She had the resources, as Madam Yu had always told herself. The Bai Yu who had married into the Kang Family decades ago was rendered sterile in a car accident, and she would never had dared to imagine herself mothering 40 children. Twenty years of giving gave her wrinkles and white hairs, as well as the loving title, "mom". It was all good.</p><p>None of this would've happened had that girl not collapsed in her yard when the war had just started. Bloody shrapnel wounds covered her body. The trail in the dirt showed she had been dragging herself. By her side was a crying little boy, cleaner that her but no less wounded. She had escaped here with her son from the capital, where the war had started. That was all they could learn. She didn't make it. Her boy did. The fear in his eyes kindled something new in the widow: something she had never felt in her 42 years of life, for there had never been the need for it. She wondered why it hadn't awakened sooner.</p><p>She had the money. She couldn't save everyone, but she could at least help the children. She had scoured the streets for orphans since.</p><p>The first boy who had started this all now stood next to her with a patch over his left eye and a scarred left cheek. He had stayed to help after coming of age, like Camilla next to him, and the other caretakers. They were Madam Yu's extra hands, comforting the newcomers and breaking up fights, carrying out duties unfit for the younger children and assisting the homeschooling teachers with classes and homework. The life in the orphanage was the only life they knew, and they were content sticking to it.</p><p>Not that there hadn't been people who <em>did</em> leave. The local butcher who tipped the chef off probably knew Yubo, who had left to learn the trade two years ago. There had been many who left the city for the coast, and maybe even fled overseas. A few had been drafted into the L.A. Some had married. One, Iris was told by a scandalized Madam Yu, became a prostitute, married to a general, and absconded with him overseas.</p><p>It was only one more year until Iris became 18 herself. She had already made up her mind to live out her life in the orphanage. She had nothing out there, but in here, she had everything: people to love and to take care of, chores to be done, a life. The life at the orphanage was the closest to what little she could remember of what she had lost. She couldn't bear to lose again. The only thorn would be the head chef, but one couldn't have everything.</p><p>But if the war <em>did</em> come into the city... The memory of a shell blasting the ground apart and sending everything flying---tree trunks, cement chunks, pipe pieces, and Rubik's grandmother---</p><p><em>No, don't think about it.</em> Iris gritted her teeth and blocked the memory out. She avoided Anne's shrewd gaze and steadied her arm. <em>Things'll be alright, and Rubik and I'll stay here, safe, and end up getting---</em></p><p>"Big sister Iris?" A small boy looked up from his filled bowl.</p><p>"Hmm?" Iris snapped out of it. "More, Timmy?" She reached for a spare bowl.</p><p>"No, um..." He went red. The girl next to him smirked. He held up a twig of orchid.</p><p>"Why, thank you, Timmy!" Iris leant to let the small boy put it in her hair.</p><p>"Um... Will you marry me when I grow up?"</p><p>Iris gave a light snort, and Anne doubled up laughing beside her, dropping her tongs. Iris patted Timmy's head.</p><p>"Oh, we'll see." <em>Things will be alright.</em> She thought.</p><hr /><p>It was always a relief when the sun came out. This was when the only birds in the city showed signs of life in the surrounding woods. Some would even leave their shelters and out into the yard. This was also when the orphans vacated the mansion, filling the air with their jubilations that echoed in the grand blue above. Sunny days, especially in the summer, reminded Iris that life could be hopeful, and that happiness still existed.</p><p>She breathed in the scent of laundry. She hung up the soaked dress from yesterday and watched it sway to a halt. Iris turned around. Between the running children she saw Mr. Gao putting his bag down by the large ginkgo tree. It was time for her tutoring duty. She made her way across the yard. On the path to the outside she bade Rubik and another boy leaving for an errand be careful, and steadied a girl who ran too fast and almost tripped. <em>Lively.</em> She thought. As she approached him, she saw a thin ring of gold on the leaves.</p><p>"Isn't it too early for this?" She nodded her greeting to Mr. Gao and pointed at the leaves.</p><p>"Perhaps we're in for a harsh winter, Iris, dear." Iris always liked his warm voice. He took off his straw hat and hang it on a low branch. "Help me put up the poster, if you please."</p><p><em>Ah, history.</em> Iris pulled a face. Tutor duties were on a rotating basis. Madam Yu may be kind but she'd rather die than be lax on the orphans' education. In the early years she sent them to school, escorting them herself. When the skirmishes intensified, she bought a bullet proof van and had her valet drive them. Later, when schools closed down, she interviewed and hired two teachers: renowned Mr. Li Gao from the City Middle School and Ms. Ling Sue from a private elementary school.</p><p>"Look alive, Iris. Shan't give the kids wrong impressions." Mr. Gao came back to help. He swept away the thin hair on his balding forehead.</p><p>"It's boring. I should've swapped with Fay. <em>She's</em> the history one." Iris gave a cheeky pout at Mr. Gao's grin. She saw lines at the corner of his eyes and lips. They hadn't been there when he had first taught her.</p><p>"Boring? It's intertwined with literature! How can you like one but not the other? You did well in history, yourself."</p><p>"Probably because one doesn't always need to have wars in stories." Iris frowned even deeper. "Literature is flexible. I can write my own ending if I don't like a story. But history? We're stuck with it, however much we may regret."</p><p>"Much like this war. Very wise, Iris." Mr. Gao stabbed the pins into the poster. Iris didn't respond. She had never heard him even mention the war in class, if ever outside of it. "Don't tell anyone... Mrs. Yu frowns upon contemporary politics in class but we aren't in one yet---this war is rigged from the start."</p><p>"What?" Iris asked despite herself. Conspiracies were the last thing she had expected from him.</p><p>"Yes, rigged. Look, the Liberal Party and the People's Party co-existed for two centuries after the end of the Colonial Era," Mr. Gao muttered to the poster, all smiles gone. "There has been no serious tension between the two before war. The day prior they were signing joint amendments for a more inclusive freedom of speech, and the following day the liberals handed in a draft motion for a single-party government to the General Assembly. Nobody could pinpoint the originator of the idea. It was as if the Liberals and the President went mad overnight. The third day, the People's Party unveiled their hitherto non-existent military. Remember that the army in this country obeys the General Assembly, which the Liberals hold the majority. Where did any of these things come from, and so fast? We've never known we had resources to fight among ourselves for 20 years straight, either. This civil war has been the bloodiest and the most devastating war yet, and they are still at a literal stalemate on each front. How is that possible with no foreign intervention at all?"</p><p>"Right... Conspiracies..." Iris refocused her attention just in time. She heard enough to ask, just to be polite, "Is that why mom doesn't allow you to teach it?"</p><p>"Oh, now you're interested?" Mr. Gao tilted his head. "Have you ever thought about college, Iris?" She stared. "They study more recent events there without much restriction, though it'll be hard to attend one within the country now... The most prestigious schools had to band together and move to the border to avoid war. It's better to just leave the country... Just a thought."</p><p>"I'm going nowhere."</p><p>"Listen, Iris. I should've had this talk with you last year." Mr. Gao held onto her shoulder with on hand and held up a finger with the other. His black eyes had those piercing look of whenever he tried to drill a concept into the class' heads. Iris thought that his aging couldn't be more obvious. "Listen... you've got a knack for the academia. I still have your final essay on literary comparison between the East and the West---way beyond the understanding of an average sixteen-year-old. I would be devastated---<em>devastated!</em>---if you ended up as a mere housewife, you hear that? <em>Devastated! Go to college! Change your life! Leave the country if you have to!</em>" He shook his finger and yelled.</p><p>"R-right." Iris took a startled step back. She should've just kept her mouth shut all along. Mr. Gao swept aside his hair again, which had fallen from his agitation. He knocked on his forehead and eased himself.</p><p>"My apologies." He patted her shoulder. "Let's gather the kids for class." Iris nodded, still a bit shaken. Mr. Gao called after her as she went, "Do consider it, though, yeah?"</p><hr /><p>The butcher who tipped off the chefs had been right. By September, tanks had pulled into the city, patrolling the streets alongside squadrons of soldiers. Planes were also sighted overhead more often, passing twice every hour. Sometimes they were higher up, but most of the time they were low enough for Iris to see the flags at their side. The red ones with three golden stars in the middle were the Liberation Army; the half red-half yellow ones were the People's Party. Whenever the latter showed up, there would guaranteed be a missile or two flying at it. Iris know when to hide. The patrols would blare warnings to the civilians in the buildings as they went, telling them to stay off the street or to evacuate. Most of the time, these irritating screeches were drowned by the whistles and explosions of mortar shells.</p><p>Life at the orphanage became miserable. Blasts could be heard for miles around; even when it was too far away, the orphans could still feel the quakes under their feet. The death toll made the errand duties a test of courage. Body heaps weren't exclusive to People's Boulevard anymore. Iris had never seen so many on their own street. It was an Indian Summer, and the foul stench kept even Rubik away. The volunteers couldn't keep up. It wasn't long before they stopped because of the Liberation Army's imposed curfew. All violators were to be killed on sight. The market they frequented added two more pieces of steel board to their pre-existing ones that guarded the entrance; the supplies dwindled, as well: more troops were garrisoned in the city, sapping the stockpile and redirecting the produce suppliers entering the city to their own storehouses.</p><p>"At some point we won't be able to go out at all." Fay said one dinner, shaking her head.</p><p>"Mom was beating herself up for not buying live chickens and hens earlier." Rubik replied, all his usual frivolousness evaporated. "She asked us to till more land in the yard. We had to uproot half of the flower patch for it. I'm sorry." He glanced at a horrified Iris. "You're the only iris here now."</p><p>"It used to be guerrilla warfare." Mr. Gao made a rare appearance one dinner. Everybody was present: Madam Yu, Ms. Sue, the chefs, the servants, and even the two teacher's families. A grim air hung over the hall. "That means the People's Army was sending smaller groups of soldiers to harass the Liberation Army, hoping to chip away their strength and control. It seems that the People's Army deemed their efforts has paid off and their time has come. News is that they are amassing to the south of the city with heavy weaponry: tanks, mortar, cannons, and are advancing into the city. The Liberation Army is responding with equal measure. I'm afraid they might finally clash head-on."</p><p>The orphans exchanged worried looks. The adults in the front frowned at the floor. Somebody knocked a spoon off the table. The <em>clang</em> reverberated for a long while.</p><p>"More Liberation Army reinforcements are due in a few weeks." Mr. Gao checked the newspaper in his hand, and passed it to Madam Yu and Ms. Sue. "They will keep hoarding resources. A stray shell might cut our grid, too."</p><p>"Thank you, Li. There's still time to prepare. We cannot let our children out to the streets anymore." Madam Yu said, glancing the article.</p><p>"No. I'm afraid not." Mr. Gao replied. "We should think about evacuation, seeing how the situation escalated in other cities. Right now it's only drones flying up there. Those could become---"</p><p>"If anything happens, we'll flee into the bunker in the woods by way of the basement. Children, we will have an evacuation drill tomorrow. Staffs. meeting in the reading parlor at 7:30, please." Madam Yu cut in. "No need to startle everyone further." She whispered into Mr. Gao's ear, yet already a small girl was whimpering at the table behind Iris, Fay, and Anne. Anne turned and drew her in.</p><p>"Are we going to die?" He muffled voice was thin. The younger children who heard her started to snivel, too. They looked at Anne. Anne looked at the girl in her arms.</p><p>"Don't worry. We won't." She whispered. "Tina, it'll be alright, okay? It'll be alright."</p><p>It did not go alright. Coming November, their meals were cut down to having porridge four days a week. In the first weeks there were still chunks of meat in the bowl; these soon shrank in size, and the orphans would spend more time sifting through the food for bits of nonexistent fat than actual eating. One December day, they were gone from the porridge altogether. During one of their three days of normal meal, Iris found a strip of paper-thin beef in her plate that she could almost see through. She rolled her chopstick. It stuck onto it and disappeared. <em>At least that was one bit of meat.</em> She didn't know whether to laugh or not.</p><p>The staffs and some of the older orphans volunteered to save some of their meal portions for the younger children, a few of whom, unable to understand the situation, threw tantrums over the meager amount of their meals. Eventually these ceased. Nobody had extra energy to spare. Even the head chef shut up in the kitchen.</p><p>"I never know Anne could look pretty." Rubik said in a carrying whisper one breakfast to Iris, who tore and stacked her slice of bread hardly bigger than her palm. "It must be that she's... <em>not fat</em> anymore."</p><p>Iris grimaced. Of all the expressions in the world he had to go for that one. Anne, however, didn't take the bait, but shook her head and gave her bread a bitter grin.</p><p>"Just have to be a dick in a time like this." She muttered and fed Tina, who refused to take it. "C'mon, I'm not hungry."</p><p>"Sorry. I was trying to make light of it all..." Rubik was sincere.</p><p>People had looked to him and some other boys for lively spirits. It was strange how all they used to extract from others with their jokes were silent eye-rolls, whereas now, Madam Yu had them tell a joke before every dinner. The dining hall would heave a collective, exasperated sigh as the highlight of the day.</p><p>Iris kept to her room when she wasn't on chore or tutoring duties. When she did step outside, she kept close to the mansion and the woods. The chefs and the servants had taken over the errand duties. Every time they came back, there would always be a piece of bad news: power station explosion; suicide bombers; buildings set on fire; neighborhoods obliterated; one more merchant missing... The People's Army were encroaching the southern district of the city with bombardment tactics. Mortar shells rained down at random. The Liberation Army deployed mortars and cannons as well along the People's Boulevard. Iris felt tired, so tired of the penetrating sounds of explosion from that direction. Even at night, the noise of war didn't cease. Bursts of guns went off like firecrackers. They hammered on her brain.</p><p>Iris had forgotten what a sunny day looked like. Her window opened to the south, and she could always see smoke rising beyond the trees and the the buildings, wisps of gray from the weaponry or torrents of black from fire. Sometimes it'd be dust thrown up as well, by buildings tumbling to the ground, carrying god knew how many lives with it, sending a tremor so powerful that Iris had to lift her feet off the floor. The coming snow muffled the cannon blasts somewhat, and also silenced the birds. The air was so dead that Iris began to wonder: <em>had</em> there been any birds before? That day when Mr. Gao told her to go abroad for school was vague like the buildings in the haze. <em>Leave the country if you have to.</em> Death---that was what the haze was, and it drew closer with each passing day. <em>When will it arrive? I'm not ready...</em> Iris forced herself not to think about it without avail. <em>Death is coming. Leave the country.</em> She shook her head. Her stomach growled.</p><p>She leaned against the window. Cold panels met her forehead and she pressed on. Black smoke in the distance to the right. <em>They are burning the park.</em> Iris thought. The hilltop park that Madam Yu used to take them to years ago, when things weren't that bad, when skirmishes were the only open conflict, when cannons and mortar were confined only to the suburbs. Standing atop of that hill in the afternoon sun, overlooking the city that was yet to be broken, watching how a thin veil of glory coated the aged buildings and graffitied the sky, she had thought it would all be better. The city used to be beautiful. Its hills made the landscape three-dimensional. Buildings layered over each other, one row after the next, like a bastion. There were cathedrals and churches, at least two hundred years old, from the Colonial Era, watching the much younger skyscrapers across the city, red bricks in the west and gray steels in the east. Together with the trees they hid the body-ridden streets and gutters below. The view would be much different now. They had stopped going up there for years. Rubik would sneak her over on their errand duties, however. The two of them would hide in the shades of the grove, watching the smoke and lights from the skirmishes below. Rubik might steal a kiss, but that was all. The time when they could be the only ones in the world... Iris returned to her desk.</p><p>Those days might never be again.</p><p><em>Oh no. Those days</em> will <em>never be again.</em> She had to stop deluding herself. For one, the war. Things were already going south at a fast pace since the war was brought to their doorsteps. The orphanage wasn't a fort; it would not hold on for long. Who knew when the war in the city would end, either: if a civil war could go on outside for 20 years, then it'd go on in here for 20 years---or even 40, 70, a century. They'd be long gone before it was over. For another---<em>gone.</em> They'd be <em>gone</em>---to another city, another country. Specifically, <em>them</em>: Iris, Rubik, and five other orphans neither too old to be indispensable to the daily functions of the orphanage nor too young to be undependable to carry out an task.</p><p>"I need to send you away." These words were calm and firm, gray and nonchalant as the sky overhead. Madam Yu had them for a walk yesterday. The woods around their orphanage spread in all directions for two to three kilometers, and they could walk for a while. They had passed the fence; they had passed the stumps; they had passed the small clearing; ten more minutes of idle remarks and wandering before they came to the small reservoir for the orphanage. Madam Yu stopped Fay by her side and turned around for those words, "I need to send you away."</p><p>Iris didn't know how to express the shock, surprise, uncertainty, dismay, and fear brewing inside her, so she kept quiet. Others, especially a boy and Rubik, couldn't show much restraint. Anne was on the verge of tears. Madam Yu waited for the outbursts to pass, and explained how it was the only logical solution to the supply shortage problem. It was mutually beneficial: they would start a life outside the shadows of war, and the orphanage would be able to last a while longer. The seven of them also had a task: find a new location for the orphanage overseas. Group by group, Madam Yu would send the rest of the orphans out of the war zone, too.</p><p>Iris couldn't argue even if there wasn't a task involved. She wasn't the type to fight back, and already her mind was convincing herself not to argue: Madam Yu didn't make rash decisions, and the plan must have been in discussion for months; she would also not make any decision that would do them harm; obtaining the documents and passes from the military had taken much of her efforts and money; the seven of them---all between 16 to 18---were indeed the best candidates for this; travel expenses and large living allowances were prepared for each of them, and one of Madam Yu's friends were to receive them at the port on the other side, so it'd be all fine; they'd be together, still; they'd have no wars to worry about...</p><p>"Wen Gong---" That was her valet, "---will drive you to the coast and see you off. I'm very sorry that I cannot accompany you." Her expression softened and she spread her arms. "Let's at least make this last month memorable."</p><p>Sitting in the chair was no different from standing under the black boughs yesterday. It was gloomy, and though Iris was dressed for cold, she felt otherwise. Anne and one of the boys had not been happy to hear this. Anne went as far as to kneel down and beg Madam Yu to swap her place with Camilla. Madam Yu wasn't moved. The boy was furious that they weren't consulted beforehand, but Iris could understand: the Matron had left them out to avoid changing her mind. She had a soft heart, but she was still a business woman. She knew better than anyone about risks and logic- (and profit-) based decision-making. There were decisions that cannot involve sentiments. It was why she had to keep the head chef, even after all the rumors of what he had done to Cam. They were both irreplaceable here. Cam, who was also Madam Yu's pride, who inherited this mentality of hers (maybe except with fussing over Iris; Iris gave a slight pout at this: what could she do about it), was even said to take over the orphanage if mishap befell Madam Yu. Every plan made by the Matron was the result of careful calculation, and her will was as adamant as her heart was kind and loving. Any resistance, like resisting the war, was already lost before it had even started.</p><p>Fay was enthusiastic, though: one of the three. A new life with no war was all she ever wanted, as she had told Iris last night, before turning in. <em>Did she ever go to other girls' rooms for these night chats?</em> Iris wondered as she sat there, reminiscing. <em>Or boys'?</em> Like Rubik, Fay loved to talk. Unlike Rubik, she had more sense and tact. Iris could see her thin eyes compressing into even thinner lines again.</p><p>"I'm getting glasses the first thing I get there. I can finally see better. And look better." Fay added in an afterthought. She had lain outside Iris' sheets, holding onto Iris like holding onto a doll. Iris could count her eyelashes. "Think about it, a new life, the best New Year present mom can give us." That was true. At least Madam Yu had waited after the Spring Festival, or the rare feast they had would've been ruined.</p><p>"You should tell Anne. To cheer her up."</p><p>"She has nothing to look forward to. But <em>you</em> do. Think for me, one word: <em>Rubik</em>." Fay rolled off Iris' bed and left with a sly grin.</p><p>It had tickled Iris then as it tickled her now. There was a glimmer of hope in leaving for overseas. Rubik and her wouldn't need to hide the fact that they were even closer than what the adults thought anymore. They could live together, find jobs together, get married, and start a family (Iris' heart raced), a new life. They'd rent a separate place from others, nothing fancy, just enough to be made cozy. They'd work as a maid and a cook to save up some more money (<em>Had to get that thing flowing; can't count on the allowance forever</em>), and hopefully there wouldn't be a creep as the head chef. Then they'd find a better home. She might even be able to apply to college---that <em>did</em> sound nice. She'd become a teacher and teach literature. Of course, they'd find a new place for the orphanage at the same time. Shouldn't forget that...</p><p>Outside, snow climbed the glass panel, stepping on top of each other from the window frame. Inside, the room was just warm enough. Madam Yu had allowed the butler to chop down trees in the woods for firewood. Coal and gas were confiscated at the city border. The armies were ruining everyone's lives. Darkness fell and Iris let it fall. The power station had been bombed weeks ago. Thanks to the haze, daylight wasn't enough for the solar panels anymore. They needed to be frugal with electricity. Iris didn't need light anyways.</p><p>The war was ruining everything. Iris hated both armies for it. How lucky would it be to grow up in a peaceful place, where wars would never exist. Even when overseas, they wouldn't be immune. What if that country erupted its own civil war?</p><p>Darkness fell completely, choking her. Her stomach growled. More watery porridge today. Maybe when spring comes, they'd start harvesting fast-growing vegetables... People were hungry, and Iris feared some of the younger orphans like Timmy would starve to death. That grotesque image refused to leave her mind.</p><p>An orange glow grew from the doorway. It emerged and threw the room into a flickering light. Iris gasped and was dazed for a spell. Bit by bit, her room came back to her: the paintings she drew of Anne and Fay on the pale yellow wall, the sepia photo of her in Madam Yu's arms on her sixteenth birthday on the desk, the dried-up twig of orchid from Timmy stuck in a glass of water nearby, and the austere wire-framed mirror beside that, reflecting her tidy bed and her stuffed bunny, her first birthday present from Camilla. Then Rubik's familiar thin face blocked it all. He looked concerned. <em>Oh, he shaved his chin for the first time.</em> Iris thought.</p><p>"Iris, dinner. You alright?"</p><p>She was gripping the edge of her desk, nails digging into the wood. She rounded on him, grabbed him, and pulled him down to her. Rubik narrowly avoided spilling his makeshift oil lamp. He set it down on the desk with a <em>clang</em>, and fell into the margins of her chair.</p><p>Iris understood why Anne was so reluctant to leave, because she felt the same. Of course she also understood why she had to leave, but couldn't make peace between the two. As she sat there, her head buried in Rubik's shoulder, all of the conflicting emotions she had suppressed since hearing the news erupted. Iris couldn't remember the last time she had cried. She had to act strong for the younger orphans for too long. Crying didn't solve problems, but at least it could make her feel better.</p><p>Rubik didn't need to ask to know everything, she was sure. He returned her pressure. For once he was serious in these intimacies. He stroked her hair, not before reaching over and kicking the door shut.</p><p>"We still have a month. We have time for goodbyes." Rubik murmured. "We'll be fine out there. Fay says Japan is just like here before the war." Iris tried to stem her tears, but all she could manage was howl harder. "They didn't change their language after independence from the Brits, either. We'll be fine.</p><p>"You know what mom tells me? The ship we're boarding is as huge as this mansion. Aren't you excited to see it? How does it even float on water? Iris, we'll see it together. We'll walk up and down that thing until we're too tired to walk, just like we did when mom first took us in. Iris? C'mon, Iris. Mom says we'll be comfortable during the trip. She got us first class rooms. She says it's called a 'cabin'."</p><p>Rubik become louder and louder. He was trying to cheer her up by doing what he did the best. <em>He's hopeless.</em> Iris thought. <em>Just shut up and hold me.</em></p><p>"You know what her friend does? <em>Literature professor.</em> A critic, but also a professor. Mom put in a good word for you! They were really close before she fled there from the war. They were dorm mates in school! She'll probably just take you in as her student. I'm no good with school, but do tell me what happens when you come home every day, yeah?"</p><p>It did sound wonderful. Maybe she'd apply as soon as she could. Iris quieted down to just sobs. Rubik kept talking, stroking her hair.</p><p>"You think we'll be able to live alone? The seven of us don't have to live together, do we? We have our own money. No need to hide our thing anymore, either, I reckon. No more grown-ups around. Why did we hide it in the first place, again? It's your idea."</p><p>Iris didn't reply. Rubik always had a minty scent. She nuzzled him to get more. She'd wash the smeared shirt for him later.</p><p>"I think I'll find a job, though. You go to your classes and I'll see if we can keep the money flowing. Can't just sit on mom's allowance. Maybe I'll be an apprentice to the swordsmiths. They make damn good swords there, I've heard. You've seen the armory down in the east wing, but bet you don't know half the swords there are Made in Japan <em>TM</em>. Then I might open my own---"</p><p>"Rubik."</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>"If we ever have a child---"</p><p>"It'll be a girl, look like you, and capricious like me. Probably." Rubik said without thinking. They'd went through this too many times. "Maybe call her Lily or something. Can never have too many flowers, you know."</p><p>"That's new."</p><p>"Uprooting the flower patch was traumatizing."</p><p>"Trauma<em>tic</em>."</p><p>Rubik snorted, and kissed her hair.</p><p>"Dinner?"</p><p>Iris wanted to stay a bit longer. It was as if they were back on the hilltop.</p>]]></content>

Every year people both local and foreign enter under its twilight canopy. Many walk out unscathed; a few are never found again; some come back, and tell the strangest stories, possible only in dreams, luring, almost like the Phantoms, more people inside.</p><p>Rich games, flourishing plants, scattering ruins---these the Forest held within its bosom along with who knows what other secrets, hiding and protecting them like a mother.</p><a id="more"></a><p>As our mother drove through the tollgate, my little sister tugged me and whispered if we'd really be alright staying here. I whispered back that we would, hoping to sooth her---and myself. Counting in the other two families, we had eleven people, not one. The Forest conjured Phantoms according to a person's desires, they said, but if we stayed together it wouldn't know whose mind to base upon... Right? She took my hand. Both of our hands were cold from anxiety. Outside was the spring afternoon, warm under the sun; inside the car, in the back seat, the early-morning nip lingered still.</p><p>-- It's all just stories, right?</p><p>My sister looked at our hands.</p><p>-- I hope so---I mean, yeah, just stories.</p><p>I squeezed.</p><p>-- Be quiet!</p><p>Father snapped from the shotgun. We obeyed as always.</p><p>We never questioned our parents' orders. We have stopped questioning. We never even asked why we went on this trip, why here, of all places, or why with families of our parents' friends---or why they could even have friends. There must've been some things that we were missing in our lives---things that we, my sister and I, didn't understand. Maybe a concept, or maybe some experiences, or maybe some people.</p><p>Three white wooden cabins semi-circled a bonfire pit in the clearing we emerged into. One family each, and here began this weekend trip. Trees thick and tall towered over us; so thick were their branches that they obscured half of the sunlight, and cobwebbed the ground with their shadows where the Fu family parked their car. Their teenage twins, both with square jaws and rough contours of the faces characteristic of the Fus, stepped out and stretched. They greeted our father and mother like two docile dogs greeting their masters without as much of a glance at my sister and I. Mr. and Mrs. Fu nodded at us, and then at our parents, remarking about the smooth drive. From the other side of the Fus' car, where the branches overhead were not as dense, walked out the Chens from their car. They patted my sister's head and my shoulder, laughing about how much we'd grown. We dipped our heads in respect and greeting. I wished we could see the Chens more often. They were the only people who would treat us like they treated their own daughter. Fourteen years old like me, Chen Xi was in my year at school. We'd meet for lunch, and often she'd join me after school to pick up my little sister. She greeted the Fus and our parents, and came over to us.</p><p>-- Hi little Shanshan! How are you?</p><p>She rubbed my little sister's cheeks, calling her nickname. Jin Shan and Jin Shan---In writing our names were different but when spoken they sounded the same. Shanshan gave her a quick hug after glancing around to make sure our parents weren't looking. Chen Xi saw my face and her smile faltered to worry:</p><p>-- Shan, are you alright?</p><p>-- No. The Forest---aren't you worried?</p><p>She nodded, lips pursed. Though Mystic Forest was not far from our town, the stories had kept us at bay.</p><p>-- Childish.</p><p>Came the cold scoff from the Fu's sister twin. None of us dared to retaliate. I stared, somewhat apprehensive of the bow she and her brother were stringing. She snapped:</p><p>-- What are you looking at, kid?</p><p>I dropped my gaze to my feet. My sister clung to my arm and didn't let go until the twin look away. Chen Xi's parents ushered us to the bonfire pit. The grown-ups were assigning cabins to each family and unloading the provisions for the next two days.</p><p>-- Get here and help.</p><p>Mr. Fu called to the twins.</p><p>-- We're going hunting.</p><p>The brother grunted. Mrs. Fu objected, and Mr. Fu made to grab them. Nose in the air, the twins stomped into the undergrowth. Chen Xi called after them about the stories of the Forest and to be careful, but they flipped her the bird in unison without looking back, and disappeared.</p><p>-- You two, out of our way while we settle the cabin.</p><p>Our mother shooed us.</p><p>-- Do you want to join us?</p><p>Mrs. Chen asked. Chen Xi was an uncanny replica of her mother---they shared the same almond-shaped eyes that I had trouble looking into without blushing. She went on, smiling:</p><p>-- You three can team up.</p><p>I looked around for my sister's input, and found her beckoning from the info board. There was a ruin close by. She pleaded with her eyes.</p><p>-- I really think I should help my parents.</p><p>Chen Xi frowned at her mother, then sheepishly at us:</p><p>-- I'm sorry... <em>Do</em> be careful, and keep the cabins in sight!</p><p>We set off ourselves. Our parents didn't bat an eye as we trod off on the dirt path. It had always been like this: we go off on our own because our parents don't want to be bothered with us. We got in their ways just by existing in their field of vision. <em>Go find something to do.</em> Never a word of caution on our departure or an inquiry of where we went upon our return. If we were lost, I doubt they would even look for us.</p><p>-- Brother? How do we know if we meet a Phantom?</p><p>-- I---we won't.</p><p>We stopped.</p><p>-- It's too quiet. I'm scared.</p><p>-- So am I. But listen---we are together so the Forest doesn't know whose mind to use for the Phantoms, right?</p><p>I crouched down and so did she. I felt nervous, but I needed to be a proper brother:</p><p>-- Shanshan, look, the cabins are there through the trees. As soon as we lose sight of it, we turn back, ruins or no, alright?</p><p>She nodded. We stood up, Shanshan back to clinging onto my arm.</p><p>Our unease subsided as we walked on. The busyness in the forest had pushed their ways into our minds. The undergrowth had just sprouted new leaves, lush bright greens against the dark soil. Dots of petals white or pink or blue unfurled among them and along the path---small things like us, insignificant under the trees and had never seen the real sky. Forest dwellers---squirrels and chipmunks and hares---had already awoke from their wintry sleep and rustled about or scurried up the tall pines and birches. Birds chirped in the sparse rays of the afternoon sun; one fluttered into the undergrowth only to fly out in alarm as a hare leapt away. We thought we saw a deer. The Mystic Forest was as beautiful in reality as it was scary in the stories.</p><p>What if all of these were illusions, Phantoms created by the Forest, leading us on? We looked back, and there were the walls of the cabins, white and conspicuous between the brown tree trunks.</p><p>What was the point? We were already lost, anyways, lost in the peace of the busy forest, lost in our thoughts. In the welcoming, wet chill, we wondered as we wandered.</p><p>How would we know a Phantom? How did the Forest make one? How did it know what was on our minds? What was on the others' minds: the Fu twins, Mr. and Mrs. Chen's, or Chen Xi's? Were we on her mind? Was <em>I</em> on her mind? If we saw her pouting face before us, coming at us, then I'd know we saw a Phantom.</p><p>The path opened up and there was the ruin. Shanshan and I grinned at each other as we passed the sign saying, <em>Historical Ruin. Please B1e Careful of Weak Structures.</em> At its feet, the half-full trash bin told us just how people frequented this place. We were not lost.</p><p>The ruin was a small, circular structure, open to air either because it never had a roof or the roof had collapsed. The arched marble entryway was much worn and yellowed, saved from tumbling down by thick vines of ivy that also held up what was left of the walls on its either side. A marble workbench---or perhaps an altar---stood opposite the entrance, too conspicuous to ignore. The vines of ivy had crawled over blocks of fallen wall and sprawled over the floor, but avoided the workbench and the way up to it clean. Perhaps they had a mind of their own---or more like the forest rangers had cleared them deliberately.</p><p>-- What was this place for?</p><p>My sister whispered as we entered. We felt we were in awe. We felt like we were been watched. We felt we were forbidden. We turned around and around, admiring and revering the ancient structure.</p><p>-- Could be a workshop, or a temple.</p><p>I replied. The walls that still stood were bare beneath the ivies, and so was the workbench upon which we now sat. Nothing gave us a single clue of the history here. Come to think of it, we had never heard any stories about the ruins at all: what they were, who built them, when, why, or how. Nothing was recorded but their existence and abundance, as if nobody had cared. The Phantom was the only thing people ever talked about.</p><p>-- Can you still see the cabins?</p><p>I asked.</p><p>-- A little bit, yeah.</p><p>Shanshan replied, kicking her legs. She looked up. I followed suit. Why was I surprised to see the patch of blue overhead? The space within the ruin was the only place free of trees. Shanshan swayed and leant against me, asking:</p><p>-- Do mom and dad love us?</p><p>-- They feed and clothe us, and pay for our schools. So... yeah.</p><p>-- Then why aren't they like Sister Xixi's parents to us?</p><p>I didn't answer. She continued:</p><p>-- They always bring us birthday presents, and they smile at us just like they do to Sister Xixi. But mom and dad---</p><p>She shook her head and buried it in my shoulder:</p><p>-- Don't leave me, big brother. I love you.</p><p>-- I love you, too. We'll look after each other.</p><p>I held up my pinky and she hooked it with hers. We shook them: it was a promise.</p><p>When the blue overhead deepened, we hopped to the ground and made our way back.</p><p>-- Look, a deer.</p><p>Shanshan pointed. This time was for real. The animal nibbled at a flower near the side of the path. Shanshan let go of my hand and approached it, all Phantom stories forgotten. She petted its gentle head and it gazed back at her, munching.</p><p>An arrow streaked out from the trees. It grazed the chest of the deer and the animal fled. Shanshan gave a cry of pain and I rushed over. I should never have let her leave my side. This was the Mystic Forest, after all, and anything could---My hands jumped to my eyes when I saw the arrow sticking out of my little sister's thigh. She was trying hard not to cry.</p><p>-- Oh no. Oh no, no, no.</p><p>I gasped, afraid to touch anything. A rustle made me look up. It was the sister twin with her bow, another arrow notched in place. Her face was impassive---had she have no heart? She blinked once, and scowled:</p><p>-- Sorry.</p><p>That was all she said before turning back, shouting:</p><p>-- I missed the target!</p><p>I saw her bother approach, stopped, shrugged, and walked away.</p><p>-- HEY!</p><p>I couldn't tell what I was trembling from, the presence of the sister twin, my anger at their callousness, or my fear at my own sister's condition. They ignored me. I held Shanshan up:</p><p>-- Shanshan---Shanshan! Hey---Let's - let's get it out first!</p><p>It was an utter delusion. The slightest touch of my shaking hand at the arrow shaft drew out a scream of pain.</p><p>-- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!</p><p>She sobbed.</p><p>-- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!</p><p>I groaned:</p><p>-- I shouldn't have let you go---Can you---can you hold onto big brother's neck? Let's get back first---</p><p>She wasn't heavy, but neither was I. I felt my arms gave in some twenty steps later. I gritted my teeth and pressed on. Shanshan gritted hers and held back the tears. I had to keep going---It might get dark fast, and, unable to see the cabins, then we'd both be lost. Shanshan was bleeding now. Blood oozed out and stained her pants. I had to press on. Sniffling as I went I wondered where the Phantoms were now. If one of them had appeared and helped us, I'd give myself up and get lost with them willingly---but <em>only</em> after they help my little sister.</p><center>#</center><p>When Chen Xi saw me crashing my way into the clearing with Shanshan half-fainting, she looked horrified and ran to get her parents. Mr. Chen tried to dislodge the arrow, but Shanshan's screams made him reconsider.</p><p>-- What now?</p><p>Our father came out from our cabin, followed by our mother. They saw us and frowned. Our mother asked:</p><p>-- Who did you piss off this time?</p><p>-- The twins did this, eh?</p><p>Mr. and Mrs. Fu examined the arrow.</p><p>-- I'm sorry, this is going to hurt.</p><p>Mr. Fu crouched down and rolled up his sleeves. He turned to me:</p><p>-- Jin Shan, help me hold her down.</p><p>His twins chose this moment to return.</p><p>-- Look what you two did!</p><p>Mrs. Fu shrieked at them:</p><p>-- Do you even know you shot someone?</p><p>-- Yeah we do.</p><p>The brother grunted.</p><p>-- We apologized, didn't we?</p><p>The sister growled.</p><p>-- Apologized? That's all?</p><p>Mr. Fu stood up, eyes bulging:</p><p>-- Apologized? You could've killed her! What did I teach you two about the first rule of hunting?</p><p>The twins glared back at their father, and the sister strode over. I was spent after laying my little sister down, but I dared not let the twins get near her again. I scrambled up to block her advance and was shoved aside.</p><p>-- Out of my way.</p><p>She snapped. Shanshan tried to crawl backwards but the twin sat on her stomach to pin her down, and snapped off the shaft. My hairs stood on their ends as my little sister squealed and fainted. The twin stood up and threw the shaft at my side:</p><p>-- There. That's what you wanted, right? This is a reminder of not getting in the way of people's hunting.</p><p>-- What? <em>This</em> is what you---</p><p>-- What else do you want? We've already apologized, okay? It's not like we killed her!</p><p>The twin brother yelled from aside.</p><p>-- Not like---! You fucking---</p><p>I had never sworn before. It wasn't as effective at expressing my horror or my anger as I had imagined. I struggled up and lunged at the nearest twin. The sister kicked me back. Her brother would've run at me had his mother not grabbed him. I made for her over and over again, and was beat back each time. Mrs. Chen tried to hold me back while her husband tried to constrain the twin. I screamed:</p><p>-- You moron! You fucking bastard! You piece of garbage! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! Give me a gun and I'll shoot you into a dice! Give me a gun! Gimme a gun! I'll kill you!</p><p>I think it was to everyone's surprise when my father thrust his pistol in my face. I choked halfway through a word and saw his irritated face next to it.</p><p>-- Go on, take it and shoot.</p><p>He sounded irascible:</p><p>-- End this fiasco already. We'll pay the price. Go on. That's what you want, eh? Go on. You got a spine or not?</p><p>We glared at each other. For the first time in my life I felt hatred toward this man, and the woman who bore me. They hadn't come near us until now, and not a word of concern came from either of them. <em>Who did you piss off this time?</em> Oh it was our fault, was it? They fed us, they clothed us, they accommodated us: material needs were all there were. People had treated their pets better, and now, the pistol: another material support.</p><p>I ripped the pistol out of my father's hand and pointed it at the twin. She kept up her menacing glare.</p><p>-- Go on. It's already loaded. What, don't have the balls for it?</p><p>My father sneered.</p><p>-- Go on. Just remember if you kill one person you'll never go back, boy.</p><p>My mother jeered from steps away, arms crossed.</p><p>-- What are you two saying?</p><p>Mrs. Chen found her voice. She tried to lower my arm, and whispered into my ear:</p><p>-- Xiao Shan, don't do it. Listen to Auntie, Xiao Shan, don't do it! You can't do this---</p><p>I broke free of her and stuck the pistol against the sister's head. I ignored Mr. Chen's whispers, too. All I could think of was that I would enjoy this, I would enjoy this, I would enjoy this. Nothing---nobody---would stop me. I sneered and felt my arm buckle away.</p><p>Chen Xi, one hand around my hand and the other in the crook of my arm, gently guided me away from the twin.</p><p>-- Please don't do this, Shan. Don't listen to them! You don't want to do this. Let it go---I know you're worried about Shanshan but look---she's fine for now, just fainted---my parents'll get her to the clinic tomorrow, first thing in the morning! Drop the pistol---come on, just drop it---I don't want you to be a murderer! Neither does Shanshan! Yes, drop---there, there...</p><p>My legs gave away under her whimpers. What had come over me? Now, there was only remorse. It seeped into my body with Chen Xi's fragrance. They replaced the last bit of strength I had left. What madness had come over me? Was it the Forest's spell? I didn't dare to look at the others. The loathsome pistol was by my feet and I didn't want to look at that, either.</p><p>My father picked it up and returned to the cabin. I heard my mother spat:</p><p>-- Oh the drama!</p><center>#</center><p>I woke up to relieve myself, and it was a while before I remembered where I was. I took care climbing down the ladder of my bed to not wake my sister on the bunker below. Her forehead started burning before we had turned in, and I could feel the heat as I reached the floor.</p><p>In the mirror of the bathroom was the haggard me. My hair was disheveled from the tossing and turning in my sleep and my fringes were plastered to my forehead. My eyes were bigger and wilder than they really were above my hollow cheeks. I looked lost. My little sister was in pain and fever, and neither of my parents bothered to provide care. How could the others ever be friends with them? Especially the Chens---would they shun us from now on? Mr. Fu had pulled my father aside after dinner, looking serious---he and Mrs. Fu had been at each other‘s ears ever since the scene I'd made. He and my father made the business quick, whatever it was. They had come back, each stuffing away their wallets and phones, laughing like nothing had ever happened. What? How?</p><p>-- Nobody would talk to me anymore, not after they saw what I tried to do.</p><p>I said to my reflection. I had been avoiding everyone, especially Chen Xi. When she had called me for dinner I pretended not to have heard her at my sister's side, not moving until she had left. I felt ashamed. What would she think of me now? A murderer? An unstable madman? She reassured me again that her parents would drive Shanshan to the nearest clinic the next morning when we did the dishes. I wished we could get her there <em>now</em>. My little sister needed help <em>now</em>. What if her fever did damage to her brain? What if she missed the optimal treatment time by then and lost her leg?</p><p>A tap came from the window and I jumped. Chen Xi's face loomed from the night beyond. I stared. She tapped again with more urgency.</p><p><em>We need to get the arrowhead out</em> were the first words she said when I slid the window open:</p><p>-- Let's get her to the ruin nearby. It has a bench that can make things easier. Come.</p><p>I lost no time sneaking Shanshan out, wrapped in her quilt. Chen Xi carried a knapsack and an oil lantern. She led the way. On the ground, and around the trees, her flickering flame brought shadows to life. The chilly night was quiet except for the occasional hoots of an owl and our breaths.</p><p>-- Aren't you afraid? The Mystic Forest and the Phantoms?</p><p>I asked, panting.</p><p>-- Not right now.</p><p>She didn't turn her head, saying:</p><p>-- It's pretty soothing, the Forest, like a mother, protecting all the ruins and secrets within, don't you think so?</p><p>-- But the Phantoms and the missing people? What if we---?</p><p>I slowed down and leant against a tree. I needed to take a breather. My arms and my body were sore from earlier. She stopped and turned to wait. It was the first time I saw that she was in a simple white gown and bare-foot. With her black hair flowing down she looked beautiful in the flickering light. Give her wings and she'd be an angel. I gaped:</p><p>-- Aren't you cold?</p><p>-- Not if we hurry.</p><p>She was rather icy and distant. It had to be what had happened earlier. I should be glad that she wanted to help at all.</p><p>She lifted the shield in the lantern when we reached the ruin. In the full light the shadows and the night made the place look even more foreboding. I hesitated before stepping inside. Chen Xi laid her stuff on the marble and pointed where Shanshan should be. I rearranged her quilt so that she had as little contact with the cold surface as possible.</p><p>From the knapsack Chen Xi produced a small bottle of clear wine, a lighter, and a paring knife. She poured the liquor over the blade and set it alight. She did the same to a piece of cloth. To my amazement it didn't catch on fire.</p><p>-- Would it really work?</p><p>-- It's YangShao, 70% alcoholic content.</p><p>She replied.</p><p>-- Where did you get all these?</p><p>-- My parents' stuff.</p><p>It came so curt that it hurt. I backed off, but she ordered me to stay by my sister's side. She rolled off Shanshan's pajamas.</p><p>I gasped at the swollen leg. The flesh around the wound was dark purple. The whole thigh flared like it'd explode. Unfazed, Chen Xi dabbed the area with the liquor. Shanshan groaned, and flung open her eyes. They were full of terror.</p><p>-- Big brother, where are you---</p><p>-- I'm here. I'm here. Look, Sister Xixi is going to help you. It'll be alright...</p><p>-- Flip her around and wipe this on her forehead and back. It helps with the fever.</p><p>Chen Xi handed me the cloth and the liquor. I was about to object when she looked at me straight in the eye and said:</p><p>-- Don't worry about the cold. She's already having a fever.</p><p>I obeyed. She took the knife and made two cuts around the wound. Shanshan moaned in pain and delirium. I tried my best to calm her. The groans became louder as Chen Xi pried and worked her way around the metal with the paring knife.</p><p><em>Should've done this with the shaft still in there.</em> I thought.</p><p>-- Never should've let her snap the arrow off.</p><p>Chen Xi muttered.</p><p>Shanshan had fainted again from pain. It was probably for the best. With one final prick she took the arrow head out. It was a small thing, no bigger than my pinky nail, bloody but otherwise intact. The wound shouldn't be deep based on the size of this. Chen Xi sanitized the cloth again and wiped the black blood off the wound. She put a piece of gauze to it and secured it with bandages. I watched her press her hands over the wound and close her eyes, as though praying.</p><p>-- She should be fine now.</p><p>-- Thank you... I didn't know you can do operations.</p><p>-- I wanted to try. Maybe... maybe I should be a doctor.</p><p>She gave a nod, already cleaning up. I missed her smiles. I guessed it meant that something had really changed between us. Sullen, I turned to my sister to avoid looking at Chen Xi, but she tapped my shoulder, a faint pouting smile around her lips:</p><p>-- Hey... take her back now. She'll be alright.</p><p>-- I should help cleaning up.</p><p>-- Don't worry about me. I'll be fast. You go ahead. Be careful.</p><center>#</center><p>My little sister patted me awake. It took me a second to realize how unusual this was. I snapped my eyes open, and there she was, kneeling by my side on the upper bunker. Shafts of sunlight peaked through the curtains and lit up her excited smile.</p><p>-- You climbed up yourself?</p><p>I asked in disbelief.</p><p>-- Yes! Look!</p><p>She pulled down her pajamas to show me her thigh. She had taken the bandages off. The swell had subsided. A half-closed white scar replaced the wound and the cut.</p><p>-- This is great! It's a miracle.</p><p>I breathed and hugged her:</p><p>-- Put the bandages back on, Shanshan. It still needs to heal. You really shouldn't have taken them off.</p><p>She nodded:</p><p>-- I'm sorry. I was curious---</p><p>-- What are you two doing now?</p><p>Our mother's sleepy voice, full of disapproval, came from across the room.</p><p>-- Look, mom. My leg's healed!</p><p>Shanshan dangled her leg over the bunker railing.</p><p>-- Great. We don't need to visit the clinic anymore.</p><p>She flipped back to the other side.</p><p>I took out the arrowhead from my jeans pocket and showed it to Shanshan:</p><p>-- Can you remember what happened last night?</p><p>-- I'll thank Sister Xixi at first chance!</p><p>Mr. and Mrs. Chen weren't completely convinced that my little sister didn't need more medical attention, but my parents waved their worries away. Even Shanshan skipped around to put them at ease:</p><p>-- It was all thanks to Sister Xixi!</p><p>-- Oh really?</p><p>Mrs. Chen smiled to hide her bemusement.</p><p>After breakfast we prepared for the day's trek. Mr. Fu took the lead:</p><p>-- Okay. To be safe, let's stick with our own families and keep each other in sight---WHERE ARE YOU GOING?!</p><p>-- Hunting. We're going ahead.</p><p>Grunted the brother twin.</p><p>-- So we shoot nobody.</p><p>The twin sister scoffed.</p><p>They strode off without another word.</p><p><em>Good riddance.</em> I thought, grabbing my little sister's hand, and we set off.</p><p>-- Stay on the path and don't follow strangers, hear that?</p><p>Our father said, impatient as ever:</p><p>-- This is the Mystic Forest, you hear? I said, you hear?</p><p>-- Yes, father.</p><p>We chanted.</p><p>The Forest in the morning was true to its name, and more eerie than it was at night. It was shrouded in a mist that dampened all sounds and dulled all senses. Pale streaks of sunlight fought their ways in from between the branches, long fingers reaching for us, passing over us, as though they would grab us any second. It was strangely beautiful, as well. The quiet and the chill of April, the mushy soil under our feet, the veiled greens, every feature we see with our eyes was painted a faint pale blue---it was a heavenly place. Peace, eerie peace, that was what the Mystic Forest was about.</p><p>-- I'm beginning to like this place.</p><p>My little sister whispered. I nodded. She was holding up well. Chen Xi really did an amazing job.</p><p>We walked, following the main trail, rested for a bit after an hour or so, and continued our way. We saw some hare and one or two deer again. They scurried off at our approach or stood observing us from afar in the undergrowth. We met no people, not even the twins. Surely there should be other hikers by now? Not everyone could afford the cabins but wouldn't the campers usually stay overnight in their tents deeper ways in? Were they coming back out, we would meet them by now.</p><p>I noticed my shoelace had come apart, and crouched down at a fork to redo them. Shanshan called for our parents to stop. They did and turned. Two seconds later they told me to hurry up and strolled ahead with Shanshan in tow.</p><p>I need to get back to them quick. This was the Mystic Forest, after all---Would anyone look for me if the Phantoms <em>did</em> get me?</p><p>I stood up to three kids walking up the other path. One of them said to me:</p><p>-- There you are. Somebody's calling for you.</p><p>They were quite small, eight or nine, a boy and two girls. Puzzled, I looked at them. Their big eyes glared back in disapproval. What did I do this time?</p><p>-- Come on already. Someone there is calling you.</p><p>One of the girls urged.</p><p>Their eyes looked familiar somehow. The shapes, the glare... they tickled my memory and for a brief second I thought I recognized them. I followed her finger down the path and saw a group of elementary school kids sitting and running around the clearing at the bottom of the slope. Who'd take them on a field trip <em>here</em>? Who over <em>there</em> would call <em>me</em>? I lifted my foot to follow.</p><p>It was as though a chord was plucked inside my head. My father's voice reverberated as its echo: <em>Stay on the path and don't follow strangers, you hear?</em> I have never in my life felt so happy to oblige the irritated voice. How could I ever forget the stories at this time? I retracted my foot:</p><p>-- I'm sorry. There's somebody who need me more right now. I'm sorry.</p><p>I fled away as polite as I could manage. My family hadn't gone far. They lagged behind the other two, strolling along as though waiting for me.</p><p>-- There you are. What, can't even tie knots anymore?</p><p>Our mother snapped.</p><p>-- Thanks for waiting.</p><p>I was grateful.</p><center>#</center><p>The Fu twins weren't there when we returned to the cabins. We hadn't seen them at all during our walk.</p><p>-- <em>The number you dialed was not available.</em></p><p>Mrs. Fu repeated, holding her phone:</p><p>-- Can they go that deep in, or...?</p><p>She furrowed her brow at her husband. We knew what she was thinking. Our hearts sank. Mr. Chen was already by the landline:</p><p>-- Let's call the rangers.</p><p>The rangers arrived in a squad of six and set off for an immediate search. We children were ordered to stay in the campground while the adults went with them. We sat on the floor in the Chen's cabin, and dozed off from exhaustion of the trek.</p><p>We woke to an evening. Mr. Chen came into his cabin with our dinner, and told us that no one had been found, yet.</p><p>-- The police are here, too. It's best for you children to stay here.</p><p>He sat down:</p><p>-- Don't worry. You'll be safe. Jin Shan, your parents are talking with them right now and the Fus are out with the rangers again. Your auntie and I will be around. You and Shanshan stay here for the night, alright?</p><p>My little sister and I nodded. He watched us eat, and left with our plates.</p><p>-- Great Mother God.</p><p>Chen Xi hugged her knees:</p><p>-- I know they are horrible but to go missing here---It must be the Phantoms...</p><p>I grimaced. Shanshan clung to my arm tighter:</p><p>-- Do you think we should go help searching?</p><p>-- We can take your dad's lantern again.</p><p>I suggested to Chen Xi.</p><p>-- Lantern? What---? We don't have one.</p>]]></content>

</script><p><em>在里面一定要当心，慎防幽灵把你引走。</em>每当人们提起森林时，他们一定会说这句话。每年都会有人踏进幽深茂密的森林里，无论是当地人还是外来旅客。他们当中的大多数会毫发无损地出来，也有一小部分人进去之后便杳无音讯，还有一些人虽然回来了，却会讲述最匪夷所思的、梦境一般的故事。这些故事犹如幽灵，把更多的人引入森林。</p><p>肥美的野味、繁茂的植被、遍布的遗迹——这一切都和其他不为人知的秘密一同被森林揽入怀中，如同母亲一般藏匿与守护。</p><p>我们的母亲开车出收费站时，我的妹妹拽了拽我的袖子，悄声问我，我们在这里是不是真的没有问题。我同样悄声地否定，希望能安慰她——和自己。加上同行的另外两家人，我们一共十一个人，而不是一个。他们都说森林只根据一个人的渴望来制造幽灵，那如果我们一直待在一起，森林就不会知道应该参照谁的……吧？她握住我的手，因为紧张，我们两人的手冰凉。车外的春天沐浴在下午温暖明媚的阳光中，而车内的后排依旧残留着清晨的萧寒。</p><a id="more"></a><p>-- 那都只是个故事吧？</p><p>我妹妹看着我们的手。</p><p>-- 但愿如——啊，对，对，只是个故事。</p><p>我挤了挤她的手。</p><p>-- 闭嘴！</p><p>父亲从副驾驶座上呵斥，我们和往常一样服从了。</p><p>我们从来没有质疑过我们父母的命令。我们很早就不再反驳。我们甚至从来没有问过他们我们为什么要出来郊游、那么多地方里为什么偏偏来这里、为什么要和我们的父母的朋友两家一起——甚至为什么他们还会有朋友。我们一生中肯定缺少什么——有些东西我和我的妹妹难以理解：可能是一个概念，或者一些经历，或者一些人。</p><p>我们抵达了营地。眼前是一个篝火坑，三栋木屋在一旁围成了一个半圆，一家一栋。周末游就此开始。周围俯视我们的树木枝条交错，遮挡了一大半的阳光，它们网一般的影子密布在付家的车位上。付家的双胞胎姐弟下车伸了伸懒腰，两个人都有典型付家的方颌骨和粗犷的脸。他们舔狗一样问候着我们父母，对我们两人却看也不看一眼。付叔叔和付阿姨先朝我们点了点头，然后转向我们的父母点头示意，说这一路车开得真顺畅。在付家车位的另一边、更为稀疏的枝条下，辰叔和辰姨也下了车。他们走过摸了摸我妹妹的头、拍了拍我的肩，笑着说我们又长高了不少。我们有礼貌地颔首问好。我真希望我们能更常见到他们，因为他们是唯一像对待自己孩子一样对待我们的人。他们的女儿辰曦和我一样十四岁，并和我同校，我们有时一起吃午饭，放学后她也常跟我一起接我妹妹。问候完付家和我们父母之后，辰曦走了过来。</p><p>-- 你好嘛小珊珊？</p><p>她揉着我妹妹的脸，叫着她小名。晋珊和晋山——我和我妹妹的名字虽然字面上不同，但读起来一样。珊珊四下里看了一眼，在确认我们父母没在看之后飞快地给了她一个拥抱。辰曦看到我的表情之后笑容收敛成担忧：</p><p>-- 小山，你没事吧？</p><p>-- 啊……这片林子——你一点都不担心吗？</p><p>她抿着嘴点了点头。尽管神秘林离我们镇子不远，但各种关于它的故事一直让我们离它远远的。</p><p>-- 幼稚。</p><p>耳边传来了付家的双胞胎姐姐的冷笑。我们没人敢还嘴。我望着她和她弟弟手里正在上弦的两把弓，心里发怵。她冲我们怒喝：</p><p>-- 小屁孩，瞅什么？</p><p>我立刻垂下眼睛看着自己的脚。我的妹妹紧紧抓着我的胳膊，直到两个双胞胎转向别处才松开。辰曦的父母把我们带到篝火坑旁，大人们正在分配木屋并从车上卸下未来两天需要用的物资。</p><p>-- 过来帮忙。</p><p>付叔叔冲双胞胎喊道。</p><p>-- 我们要去打猎。</p><p>双胞胎弟弟哼道。 付阿姨张嘴想反驳，付叔叔伸手去抓住他们，而他们两个人仰着头踩进了灌丛里。辰曦向他们的背影喊着别忘了树林的那些故事，让他们小心，但他们头也不回，一起反手冲她竖中指，消失在绿叶里。</p><p>-- 你们俩在我们收拾屋子的时候别挡道。</p><p>我们的母亲赶我们走。</p><p>-- 想过来帮我们吗？</p><p>辰姨问道。辰曦和她的妈妈就像是一个模子里出来的——当我看着她们杏仁状的眼睛时，不脸红是不可能的。她笑着说道：</p><p>-- 你们仨可以一起。</p><p>我环顾四周找我妹妹，想听听她的想法。她正在公告板那儿招手让我过去。这附近好像有处遗迹，她的双眼充满央求。</p><p>-- 我真觉得我应该去帮我爸妈。</p><p>辰曦向她妈妈皱了皱眉头，然后又不好意思地转向我们：</p><p>-- 对不起啊……但你们<em>一定</em>要小心，别丢了木屋啊！</p><p>于是我们自己沿着土路出发了，我们的父母看到我们连一句过问的话都没有。我们一直都是自己出门玩，因为他们懒得管我们，我们只要出现在他们的视野里就是碍他们的事。<em>自己找事干去。</em>我们出门时从来没有一句叮嘱，回家时也没有一句问候。如果我们走丢了，他们可能都不会来找我们。</p><p>-- 哥哥？ 我们怎么知道我们碰没碰到幽灵啊？</p><p>-- 我——我们不会碰到的。</p><p>我们停住了脚步。</p><p>-- 好安静啊。我害怕。</p><p>-- 我也是。呃，听我说——我们在一起，所以森林不知道该用谁的脑子做幽灵，对吧？</p><p>我蹲了下来，她也跟着蹲下。我有些紧张，但我得有个哥哥的样子：</p><p>-- 珊珊，看那儿，树中间的木屋，看到了吗？我们一旦看不到它们了，我们就立刻掉头回去，不管看没看到遗迹，好吗？</p><p>她点了点头。我们站起身，珊珊重新抱紧我胳膊。</p><p>随着我们谨慎前进的步伐，我们的不安渐渐褪去，取之的是林子里涌来的繁忙和生机。黝黑的土壤衬托着低矮的灌木丛里刚萌生的鲜绿嫩叶，朵朵白色、粉色、蓝色的花瓣，或点缀其中，或在小道边盛开。这些和我们一样渺小的东西在大树脚下毫不起眼，从未见过真正的天空。森林里的居民——松鼠、花栗鼠、野兔——早已从冬眠中苏醒，它们四处乱窜，要不然就沿着高大的松树和桦树飞奔而上。鸟儿在稀散的午后阳光中鸣唱，我们看见一只飞进灌木里，又立刻被跳走的野兔惊起。我们还好像看到了一头鹿。神秘林在故事里有多可怕，它在现实中就有多美。</p><p>如果这一切都只是幻境，都仅仅是森林为了把我们引走而产生的幽灵呢？我们回头张望，远处是棕色树干间木屋那耀眼的白墙。</p><p>这一切又有什么意义呢。我们早已迷失了——迷失在忙碌的森林的祥和里，迷失在我们自己的脑海里。我们漫步在令人舒适的潮湿的微凉里，思绪随着足迹漫延。</p><p>我们如何识别幽灵？森林又如何创造幽灵？它是怎么知道我们在想什么的？别人——付家双胞胎、辰叔和辰姨、或者辰曦——又在想什么？她在想我们吗？在想<em>我</em>吗？如果我们看到她撅着嘴出现在我们面前、向我们走来，那我就知道我们见到幽灵了。</p><p>土路逐渐变得宽敞，前面就是遗迹了。珊珊和我路过写着<em>历史遗迹——请小心脆弱结构</em>的牌子时相视一笑，牌子旁边半满的垃圾箱告示我们有多少人行经于此。我们没有迷失。</p><p>遗迹不大，圆形地基，露天——也许它从来就没有过屋顶，也许它的屋顶早已坍塌。它的大理石拱门因岁月摧残而泛黄、破旧不堪，和两边的墙壁一样全靠着粗壮藤蔓的缠绕和支撑才得以避免崩垮的命运。拱门对面是一座显眼得无法回避的大理石工作台，也可能是一座圣坛。藤蔓爬过坍倒的墙壁，遍地蔓延，但却完美地绕开了工作台及通向它的路。也许它们有自主意识——或者更可能是森林管理员们故意清理的结果。</p><p>-- 这里是干什么的？</p><p>我们走进遗迹时我妹妹问道。我们对眼前的一切感到敬畏，我们感觉我们在被注视着，我们感觉我们触犯了什么禁令。我们站在原地转了一圈又一圈，欣赏着、敬仰着这座古老的建筑。</p><p>-- 可能是个工作室，或者是个神庙吧。</p><p>我回答说。藤蔓下的墙壁一片空白，毫无装饰；同样空白的是我们现在坐着的台子。这里没有任何东西可以告诉我们这里的历史。说来也是，我们从来没有听过任何关于这些遗迹的故事——它们是做什么的、谁建造了它们、什么时候建造的、为什么建造、如何建造——除了它们大量的存在，一点其他记载都没有，就好像没有人在乎一样。幽灵才是人们唯一关心的东西。</p><p>-- 你还能看见木屋吗？</p><p>我问。</p><p>-- 能看到一点，嗯。</p><p>珊珊边回答边踢着腿。她抬头望着天，我也跟着看去。我为什么会对头顶的湛蓝感到惊讶啊？遗迹上空是唯一没有被树遮挡的地方。珊珊晃了晃，然后倚到我身上，问道：</p><p>-- 爸爸妈妈爱我们吗？</p><p>-- 他们给我们吃给我们穿，还给我们付学费，所以……是吧。</p><p>-- 那为什么他们不像曦曦姐姐的爸爸妈妈对我们那样对我们？</p><p>我没回答。她接着说：</p><p>-- 他们总是给我们生日礼物，他们和对曦曦姐姐那样对我们笑，但爸爸妈妈——</p><p>她摇了摇头，然后一脸扎进我的肩膀里：</p><p>-- 哥哥，别离开我。我爱你。</p><p>-- 我也爱你。我们会互相照顾好自己的。</p><p>我举起小拇指，她用她的钩住，我们摇了摇——拉勾上吊，一百年不许变。</p><p>头顶的湛蓝加深时，我们从台子上跳下，返程。</p><p>-- 看，鹿。</p><p>珊珊指着说。这次是真的看到了，那头鹿正在小口啃着土路边的一朵花。珊珊松开我的手跑了过去，所有的鬼故事全被抛到了脑后。她抚摸着它温顺的头，它呆呆地看着她，嘴里碎碎地嚼着。</p><p>一支箭从树间飞驰而出，划过鹿的胸脯。它一惊，逃走了。珊珊发出一声惨叫，我立刻跑了过去。我就不应该让她离开我身边，这可是神秘林啊，什么都能——当我看到那支箭是扎在我妹妹的大腿里时，我的手猛地挡住我的眼睛。她正努力不哭。</p><p>-- 啊不——啊不，不，不——</p><p>我吃了一惊，不敢碰她任何一处。灌木里传来一阵窸窣声，我抬头看到是付家双胞胎姐姐，她压着弓，又一支箭已经搭在弦上。她的脸面无表情——她没人性吗？她眨了一下眼，然后脸一沉：</p><p>-- 抱歉。</p><p>然后就没了。她转身喊道：</p><p>-- 我射偏了！</p><p>我看到她弟弟走过来，停住，耸一下肩，然后走开了。</p><p>-- <strong><em>喂！</em></strong></p><p>我不知道我到底是因为双胞胎姐姐在场、因为他们的冷漠而起的愤怒、还是因为我对我妹妹的状况的恐惧而颤抖。他们没有理我。我捧起珊珊：</p><p>-- 珊珊——珊珊！嗨——我们——我们先把它弄出来！</p><p>这简直就是做梦。我颤抖的手只要触到箭杆就会引发她撕心裂肺的尖叫。</p><p>-- 对不起！对不起！</p><p>她哭道。</p><p>-- 对不起！对不起！</p><p>我呻吟道：</p><p>-- 我不该让你离开我——你能——你能抓住哥哥的脖子吗？我们先回去——</p><p>她并不重，可惜我也一样。差不多二十步以后我的胳膊就开始屈服了。我咬着牙坚持前行，珊珊咬着牙忍住眼泪。我必须坚持住——天可能很快就黑，如果我们看不见木屋，我们两个就真的迷路了。珊珊现在已经开始流血，血液弥漫而出，染红了她的裤腿。我必须继续坚持。我边啜泣边想那些幽灵现在在哪里，如果它们能来一个帮助我们，我心甘情愿跟它们走——但<em>只有</em>在它们帮助我妹妹之后。</p><center>#</center><p>当辰曦看到我抱着半清醒的珊珊冲进营地时，她一脸惊恐地跑去找来她的父母。辰叔想把箭拔出来，但珊珊的尖叫把他吓了回去。</p><p>-- 又怎么了？</p><p>我们的父亲从我们的木屋里走了出来，后面跟着我们的母亲。他们看到我们，皱起眉头。母亲问：</p><p>-- 你们这是又惹谁了？</p><p>-- 那俩双胞胎干的，嗯？</p><p>付叔叔和付阿姨对箭端详片刻，说：</p><p>-- 抱歉，这得有点疼。</p><p>付叔叔俯下身，挽起袖子。他对我说：</p><p>-- 晋山，帮我按住了她。</p><p>他的两个双胞胎恰好在此时回来了。</p><p>-- 你们看你们两人做了些什么！</p><p>付阿姨冲他们尖叫道：</p><p>-- 你们是不是都不知道射到人了？</p><p>-- 怎么不知道？</p><p>双胞胎弟弟哼了一声。</p><p>-- 我们不是道过歉了？</p><p>双胞胎姐姐生气地低声说道。</p><p>-- 道过歉了？这就完了？</p><p>付叔叔站了起来，瞪着双眼：</p><p>-- 道过歉了？你们两个都有可能杀了她！打猎最基本的规矩我是怎么教你们的？</p><p>两个双胞胎和他们的父亲怒目而视，姐姐大步跺了过来。我在放下我妹妹之后就精疲力竭了，但我一点也不敢再让任何一个双胞胎靠近她。我挣扎着爬起来去阻挡她的步伐，然后被她一把推开。</p><p>-- 起开。</p><p>她不耐烦地骂道。珊珊试图倒退爬走，但双胞胎姐姐一屁股坐在她的肚子上，使她动弹不得，然后一把折断了箭杆。我妹妹的尖叫让我的汗毛都立了起来，她晕了过去。双胞胎姐姐起身把箭杆仍在我身旁：</p><p>-- 行了。你不就想要这个？这是给你提个醒，别人打猎时少挡道。</p><p>-- 什么？<em>这</em>就是你要——</p><p>-- 你还想怎么样？我们早就道过歉了好不好？我们又没杀了她！</p><p>双胞胎弟弟在一旁喊道。</p><p>-- 你们又没——！你他妈的——</p><p>这是我头一回说脏话，然而它并没有我想象中的那样能有效地表达我的惊恐和愤怒。我奋力爬起来扑向离我最近的那个双胞胎，那个姐姐一脚把我踢了回来。幸亏她的母亲抓住了她的弟弟，否则他也会向我冲过来。我一遍又一遍地向她扑去，一次又一次地被她打回来。辰姨试图拉住我，同时辰叔也努力束缚住那个双胞胎。我尖叫道：</p><p>-- 你这个混蛋！你这个婢养的孬种！你这个人渣！我要杀了你！我要杀了你！给我把枪！看我不把你打成筛子！给我把枪！给我枪！看我不杀了你！</p><p>当父亲把他的枪摆到我面前时，我感觉所有人都吃了一惊。我话说到一半呛了一下，眼里看到的是他一脸的不耐烦。</p><p>-- 喏，接过去开枪啊。</p><p>他听起来十分烦躁：</p><p>-- 赶紧搞完这场闹剧，到时候什么赔偿金我们拿。赶紧的，你不就想要这个，啊？赶紧。你到底有没有种？</p><p>我们互相怒视对方，这是我一生中第一次对眼前这个人和生我的那个人感到咬牙切齿的憎恨。他们直到现在才接近我们，然而从他们的嘴里始终没有说出一句关心的话。<em>你们这是又惹谁了？</em>噢，这都是我们的错吭？他们给我们吃、给我们穿、给我们住的地方——换言之，满足我们的物质需求，仅此而已。别人对他们的宠物都比这个好，而眼下的这把枪，又是一项物质支持。</p><p>我从父亲的手中夺过枪指向双胞胎姐姐，她保持着威胁的目光。</p><p>-- 你开枪啊，都已经上好膛了。怎么了，胆不够？</p><p>父亲嘲弄道。</p><p>-- 射啊？但你记清楚了，杀人只有第零次和第无数次。</p><p>母亲在几步之外奚落着，两臂交叉在胸前。</p><p>-- 你们俩在说什么啊？</p><p>辰姨终于回过神来，张口说。她试着拉下我的手，在我的耳边悄声说道：</p><p>-- 小山，别开枪。听阿姨的话，小山，别开枪，啊，你不能——</p><p>我从她手里挣脱出来，枪口狠狠地顶在双胞胎姐姐的脑门上。辰叔的悄声低语我也没去听。我脑海里只回响着一句话：我会享受这个的，我会享受这个的，我会享受这个的。没有任何东西——没有任何人——能阻止我。我咧嘴冷笑了起来，然而我感觉胳膊一弯。</p><p>辰曦一手握着我的手、一手扶着我的胳膊肘内侧，轻轻地把我带到一边。</p><p>-- 求你了，别开枪，小山，别听他们的！你不想开枪的！放手吧——我知道你只是担心珊珊，你看——她现在没事了，只是昏了过去——我爸妈明天一早就送她去医院，真的，起来第一件事就是送她过去！把枪丢了吧——听话，扔了它——我不想看你成为杀人犯！珊珊也不想！对，扔了——嗯好了，好了……</p><p>我在她的呜咽里双腿一软。我刚才这是怎么了？现在剩下的只有随着辰曦身上的花香味浸入我身体每个角落的悔意，而它把我最后的一点力气也熄灭了。我刚才怕是疯了吧？这是森林施的魔咒吗？我不敢看其他人，也不敢去看在我脚边的那把恶心可憎的手枪。</p><p>父亲捡起枪转身走回木屋。我听到我的母亲骂道：</p><p>-- 哎哟，这戏演的！</p><center>#</center><p>我半夜醒了，想解手，花了好一会儿才想起来我在哪里。我小心翼翼地爬下梯子，以防吵醒下床的妹妹。在睡觉前她的额头就开始发烫，现在我刚落地，依然能感到一股热浪从她的额头袭来。</p><p>洗手间镜子里是憔悴的我。我的头发因为在睡梦中辗转反侧而乱蓬蓬的，刘海也紧紧地黏在额头上。在消瘦的脸颊上，我的眼睛看起来比实际上更大、更涣散。我看起来真的好迷茫。我的妹妹在忍受着痛苦和高烧，然而我的父母没有一人愿意给予她一丝安慰和关怀。其他人为什么会成为他们的朋友？尤其是辰叔和辰姨——他们从现在开始会躲着我们了吗？付叔叔晚饭后把我的父亲带到一旁，一脸严肃。他和付阿姨自从我引发的那一幕之后就一直要着对方的耳根。我的父亲和他很快就把事情解决了——到底什么事情，鬼知道。他们回来时，各自往口袋里塞好各自的钱包和手机，有说有笑，就和什么事情都没发生过一样。到底发生了什么？怎么回事？</p><p>-- 大家目睹我的所作所为以后，再也没人会跟我说话了。</p><p>我对着自己的镜像自言自语。我自从那一幕起就一直躲着大家，尤其是辰曦。当她来叫我吃晚饭的时候，我坐在我妹妹床边，假装没听到她，直到她走了才挪了一下身子，心里内疚又羞愧。她现在会怎么看我？一个杀人犯？一个不稳定的疯子？我们一起刷碗时她又向我保证说他的父母明天一早就带珊珊去最近的医院。我希望现在我们就能把她送过去；我妹妹<em>现在</em>就需要看大夫。万一她高烧不退伤到大脑怎么办？万一她错过了治疗的黄金时间、因此失去那条腿怎么办？</p><p>从窗户那儿传来的一阵叩响吓了我一跳，窗外漆黑的夜里浮出的是辰曦的脸。我呆呆地看着她，她又敲了一遍，这次更加紧促。</p><p>我拉开窗后她说的第一句话就是<em>我们得把箭头取出来。</em></p><p>-- 我们把她带到附近的遗迹里吧，那里有个台子，能方便一些。出来。</p><p>我立刻把珊珊用被子裹好，偷偷抱了出来。辰曦背着一个布袋包，手里提着一盏马灯，走在前面领路。地上、树边，她手里跳动的火光赋予了影子生命。夜晚微凉寂静，除了偶尔传来的猫头鹰的叱叫，能听到的就只有我们的呼吸声。</p><p>-- 你不害怕吗，神秘林和幽灵什么的？</p><p>我喘着粗气问道。</p><p>-- 挺让人平静的啊，我是说这个森林。你不觉得吗，它就像妈妈一样保护着里面的遗迹和秘密？</p><p>-- 可是幽灵和那些失踪的人呢？如果我们——？</p><p>我放慢脚步，停了下来，倚到一棵树上。我得歇一下，我的胳膊和全身的肌肉都因为早些时候酸痛。她也停了下来，转身等着我。我这才发现她穿着一条朴素的罩衣，光着脚。在闪烁的火光里，她一头黑发及腰，好美。她和天使就差一对羽翼。我目瞪口呆：</p><p>-- 你不冷吗？</p><p>-- 如果我们快一点就不会。</p><p>她对我有点冷漠，一定是因为早些时候的事吧。我应该感到庆幸，她能愿意帮助我就很不错了。</p><p>我们到达了遗迹，她掀起马灯的遮光罩。明亮的火光下，阴影和夜晚让整个建筑看起来更阴森可怕，以至于我踏进去前犹豫了一下。辰曦把东西放在大理石台子上，指了指珊珊应该躺在哪儿。我调整了一下她的被子，确保她和冰凉的台面的接触越少越好。</p><p>辰曦从背包里拿出了一小瓶白酒、一个打火机、一把水果刀。只见她把刀身洒满白酒，然后点燃。对拿出的一块布她也做了同样的处理，然而布本身最后居然完好无损。</p><p>-- 这真有用吗？</p><p>-- 七十度仰韶，没问题。</p><p>她答道。</p><p>-- 你这都是哪儿来的？</p><p>-- 爸妈的。</p><p>她的回答简洁得让我难受。我退了两步，但她让我在我妹妹身边待好，说完便卷下珊珊的睡裤。</p><p>我看到她肿胀的腿，大吃一惊。伤口周围紫得发黑，整条大腿肿胀得仿佛要炸裂一样。辰曦拿起浸过白酒的布擦拭伤口附近的部位，镇定自若。珊珊痛苦地呻吟着，睁开双眼，眼里充满恐惧。</p><p>-- 哥哥，你在哪儿——</p><p>-- 我在这儿，我在这儿。看，曦曦姐姐在帮你，没事的……</p><p>-- 给她翻个身，拿这个擦额头、擦背，帮她退烧。</p><p>我乖乖听从。她在伤口周围划了两刀，珊珊在疼痛和迷妄中呢喃着胡话，我尽可能安慰她。随着辰曦用刀沿着箭头周围的次次挑拨，珊珊痛苦的呻吟声越来越大。</p><p><em>真应该在箭杆还在的时候干这个。</em> 我想。</p><p>-- 就不该让她把箭折断。</p><p>辰曦咕哝道。</p><p>珊珊又一次在疼痛中昏了过去，这对她来说算是最好的吧。辰曦挑过最后一下，终于取出了箭头。它很小，还没有我的小拇指的指甲大，虽然全是血，但完好无损。单凭它的大小来看，伤口不会太深。辰曦又把布消了消毒，擦干净了伤口上乌黑的血。她接着给伤口盖上纱布并用绑带缠好，双手轻轻按在上面，闭着眼，好像在祈祷一样。</p><p>-- 她现在应该没事了。</p><p>-- 太感谢了……我都不知道你会做手术。</p><p>--我就是想试试。也许……也许我以后应该当医生。</p><p>她点了下头，已经开始清理起来。我好怀念她的笑啊，看来在我们彼此之间有的东西已经变了。我转向我妹妹，垂头丧气，想回避她的身影，但她拍了拍我的肩，一抹淡淡的微笑萦绕在撅起唇边：</p><p>-- 嗯……带她回去吧，她应该没事了。</p><p>-- 我总得帮你收拾吧。</p><p>-- 不用管我啦，我很快的。你先走，路上小心点。</p><center>#</center><p>我的妹妹把我拍醒了，我半天才反应过来这有多不对劲儿。我飞快睁开眼，但是瞧啊，她就在我的床铺上，跪在我身边。窗外的阳光从窗帘的缝隙中挤了进来，照亮了她脸上兴奋的笑。</p><p>-- 你自己爬上来的？</p><p>我感觉有点不可思议。</p><p>-- 嗯！看！</p><p>她拉下睡裤给我看她的大腿。她早就把绑带拆下，大腿已经消了肿，取代原先的伤口和切口的是一个半愈合的白色疤痕。</p><p>-- 这太好了啊！简直是个奇迹。</p><p>我轻声说着，抱紧了她：</p><p>-- 把绑带缠回去，珊珊，伤口还没好彻底。你就不该把它拆开。</p><p>她点了点头：</p><p>-- 我错了，我只是好奇——</p><p>-- 你们两个又在干什么？</p><p>母亲的声音从屋子的另一边传来，睡意蒙眬，满是责备。</p><p>-- 妈妈，看，我的腿好了！</p><p>珊珊把她的腿垂过上铺的护栏给她看。</p><p>-- 好，我们不用去医院了。</p><p>她把身子翻了回去。</p><p>我从牛仔裤口袋里掏出箭头递给珊珊：</p><p>-- 你还能记得昨晚上发生了什么吗？</p><p>-- 我一有机会就去谢曦曦姐姐！</p><p>得知我妹妹不需要再去看大夫的时候，辰叔和辰姨将信将疑，但我的父母对他们的担心不以为然，就连珊珊都在他们面前蹦蹦跳跳安慰着他们：</p><p>-- 多亏了曦曦姐姐！</p><p>-- 嗯？是吗？</p><p>辰姨的微笑背后有一丝疑惑。</p><p>早餐过后我们准备开始一天的行程，付叔叔担当起了领队：</p><p>-- 来，为了保证安全，咱都跟好自己的家人，都互相看着点，别让任何人离开自己的视线——<strong><em>你们两个去哪儿？？</em></strong></p><p>-- 打猎。我们先走了。</p><p>双胞胎弟弟哼道。</p><p>-- 省得我们射着谁。</p><p>双胞胎姐姐冷笑一声。</p><p>他们两个人头也不回地大步离开了。</p><p><em>再见……再也别见。</em>我心想。</p><p>我拉起我妹妹的手，随着大部队一起出发。</p><p>-- 别离开大路，也别跟着陌生人跑了，听见没？</p><p>我们的父亲和往常一样不耐烦地说道：</p><p>-- 这可是神秘林，听见没？我说话你们听见没有？</p><p>-- 听见了，爸爸。</p><p>我们机械般回答。</p><p>清晨的神秘林名副其实，甚至比夜晚还阴森。缭绕着整座森林的雾气蒙住了一切声响、迟钝了一切感官。道道苍白的阳光从叠叠枝干中杀出了一条路，它们长长的手指伸向我们、穿过我们，仿佛随时随刻都会抓住我们。即便如此，树林依然美丽。宁静的四月清晨的微凉、我们脚下湿软的土壤、还有那一片片绿色氤氲茫茫，我们眼前的一切都被染上了一层淡淡的冰蓝——这里宛若仙境。宁静，阴森的宁静，神秘林就应该是这个样子。</p><p>-- 我有点喜欢这里了。</p><p>我妹妹悄悄说道，我点点头。她看起来还不错，辰曦的技术真的很好。</p><p>我们顺着主干林道走了差不多一个小时，休息片刻后又继续前进。一路上我们又看到一两只野兔和鹿，它们要不然一看到我们就飞快地逃走，要不然就远远地站在矮木丛中打量我们。我们没遇见任何人，甚至连那两个双胞胎都没有。可现在我们早应见到其他徒步旅者了吧？虽然不是所有人都能承担得起租木屋过夜的费用，但难道没有背着帐篷睡在林子更深处的露营者吗？如果他们过完夜往外走，我们应该早就见到他们了。</p><p>我低头发现我的鞋带开了，在一个路口我蹲下身把它们重新系起来。珊珊想叫住我们的父母，他们听到之后转身停下，但两秒之后便让我抓紧时间，伸手拉住珊珊继续前行。</p><p>我得快点回到他们身边，毕竟这里可是神秘林——如果幽灵真把我带走了，他们会来找我吗？</p><p>我系完起身时看到三个小孩子从另一条路走了过来，其中的一个对我说：</p><p>-- 你在这儿啊，有人在叫你。</p><p>他们年龄不大，八九岁的样子，一个男孩和两个女孩。我一脸疑惑地看着他们，他们的大眼睛责备地瞪了回来。我这是又做错什么了？</p><p>-- 赶紧跟我们走啊，有人在那儿叫你。</p><p>其中一个女孩催着。</p><p>他们的眼睛看起来有点熟悉：它们的形状、它们瞪着我的那种眼神……这一切好像触动了我某些记忆，有那么一刹那我感觉我好像认出了他们。我顺着女孩手指的方向看去，在山坡下、路的尽头是一片空地，一群小学生在那里，有的或坐成一圈，有的追逐嬉闹。怎么会有人带他们来这种地方春游？谁会在那儿叫<em>我</em>啊？我抬起脚要跟他们走。</p><p>如同一根琴弦在我的脑海里被拨动一般，琴弦的余音化成了我的父亲的声音：<em>别离开大路，也别跟着陌生人跑了，听见没？</em>我一生中从未如此乐于服从他那烦躁的声音。我怎么会在这种时候忘掉那些故事？我收回我的脚：</p><p>-- 对不起，有人现在更需要我过去，对不起。</p><p>我尽可能有礼貌地逃走。我的一家并没走多远，他们在另两家后面慢慢吞吞地溜达，就好像是在等我一样。</p><p>-- 你可来了。怎么，鞋带都不会系了？</p><p>我们的母亲骂道。</p><p>-- 谢谢你们等我。</p><p>我十分感激。</p><center>#</center><p>我们回到木屋时，付家的双胞胎并不在那儿，实际上我们在整个途中都没看到他们。</p><p>-- <em>您拨打的号码无法接通。</em></p><p>付阿姨举着手机重复道：</p><p>-- 他们真的能走那么深，还是……？</p><p>她冲着她丈夫皱着眉头，我们知道她在想什么，心里一沉。辰叔已经跑到固定电话旁：</p><p>-- 打电话叫森林管理员吧。</p><p>一支由六位管理员组成的队伍到达之后立刻开始搜寻工作。大人们跟着他们一起，而我们小孩子被命令老老实实地待在营地里。我们坐在辰曦一家木屋的地上，因为跋涉时的劳累昏昏睡去。</p><p>醒来时，天色已晚。辰叔端着我们的晚饭走了进来，跟我们说人还没有被找到。</p><p>-- 警察也来了。你们几个孩子最好在这里待好。</p><p>他坐了下来：</p><p>-- 别怕，你们不会有危险的。晋山，你爸妈正在和他们谈话，付叔叔和付阿姨又跟着管理员们出去了。你辰姨和我就在这儿，哪也不去。你和珊珊今晚睡这里，好吗？</p><p>我妹妹和我点了点头。他看着我们吃完饭，收拾好一下我们的盘子出去了。</p><p>-- 老天爷啊。</p><p>辰曦紧抱双腿：</p><p>-- 我知道他们特别坏，但在这种地方走丢——肯定是遇到幽灵了……</p><p>我的脸痛苦地抽搐了一下。珊珊一直抱着我的胳膊，现在抱得更紧了。她问我：</p><p>-- 你觉得我们应该去帮他们一起找吗？</p><p>-- 我们可以再带上你爸爸的马灯。</p><p>我和辰曦说。</p><p>-- 马灯？什么——？我们没有啊？</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>&quot;我们初一的时候肯定没<strong>这么</strong>吵。&quot;百合环顾了一下食堂。大中午空着肚子在乱哄哄的人群中找空桌，结果只找到一个在角落里紧凑的四人桌——这绝对不是她心目中理想的初三第一天。她的朋友们纷纷点头。&quot;真希望现在还是暑假。&quot;</p><p>&quot;绝对没准备好开学。开毛学。&quot;茱莉亚拉又过来一把椅子。</p><p>&quot;真心的。&quot;兰顿走过来说，手里的两张盘子上是一块奶酪蛋糕、四个纸杯蛋糕和两大块布朗尼饼干。他把一块饼干递给麦克斯，然后试图把另一块塞进茱莉亚嘴里，接着又把装有纸杯蛋糕的盘子递给百合和小梅。&quot;你应该是最不甘心的吧，小梅，你大部分时间都待在宝藏库里了。&quot;</p><p>小梅谢过他，点了点头。宝藏库是据她家不远的书店，她的母亲，凯特琳·莫里在那里工作。暑假期间小梅也在那里打工——她难得说服她的母亲一次。</p><a id="more"></a><p>&quot;听马肯西先生说，他特喜欢你在那里。&quot;麦克斯说。头上开始谢顶的马肯西先生是书店老板。&quot;他不当着凯特的面说，但他背地里和我们说你是店里的吉祥物。&quot;</p><p>&quot;废话。小梅一笑，谁的心不会化？要是我，我也拿她当吉祥物。&quot;茱莉亚翻了个白眼。</p><p>兰顿塞了满满一嘴千层面，但还是问道：&quot;你为啥在那儿打工来着？&quot;</p><p>&quot;帮妈妈赚钱养家呗。我爸他不是……&quot;小梅的脸越来越红，&quot;……他不是四月份滋事挑衅进监狱了嘛……&quot;</p><p>&quot;啊，对。抱歉。&quot;兰顿抖了一下，茱莉亚在桌子底下狠狠给了他一脚。</p><p>&quot;没事儿。他走了之后，家里安静多了。在书店里干活也挺好的。那啥，我一直在考虑一件事。&quot;小梅拿着叉子柄敲着下巴说，&quot;我应该用我的第一笔工资给妈妈买点什么礼物之类的……&quot;</p><p>&quot;好主意。&quot;麦克斯说。</p><p>食堂里三个级部的学生已经全部开始就餐，他们吵闹到了极点。初一的新生大声地争论着早课上的内容，炫耀着他们对课本最后一章内容的那点皮毛：什么柏拉图和洞穴预言、什么爱因斯坦和波粒二象论、什么基因和TALENs技术……初二的学生在这些无所不知的小&quot;天才&quot;背后一脸嘲弄地互相挤眉弄眼，初三的学生则和小梅她们一样，才上了一个上午的课就累得要死，懒得去关心周围发生了什么。&quot;我靠，怎么把我们搞得和高中生一样？&quot;他们抱怨道。&quot;就跟我要留在本校高中部似的。&quot;</p><p>&quot;嗯……爸爸十一月出来……我觉得我也应该给他买点什么……&quot;小梅抿着叉子尖走了神。</p><p>&quot;啊?&quot;她的四个朋友全转向她。</p><p>&quot;没什么。&quot;小梅低头开始吃沙拉。</p><p>&quot;这么早就出来了？&quot;兰顿和茱莉亚异口同声。</p><p>&quot;你打算给他买什么啊？&quot;麦克斯问。</p><p>&quot;等会儿，你等会儿。&quot;百合皱起眉头。&quot;为什么？&quot;</p><p>&quot;为什么不啊？&quot;小梅小声反问。</p><p>小梅的父亲，理查德·莫里，是阿尔瓦镇臭名昭著的酒鬼。他身材魁梧，凶神恶煞，自从十年前工厂倒闭了以后就一头栽进酒桶里，再也没出来过。他从一个受人尊重的工厂总监跌落成一个（他自己称之为）遭人唾弃的刁民时，估计跌得太狠，以至于他要是能在阿尔瓦小镇连着清醒一个月，太阳会从西边出来。理查德醉酒后极其狂怒，连当地的酒馆抖早已禁止他踏进去半步——据说酒馆的老酒保，九宝，当时得端着家传火枪把他赶出门外。他因此只能在附近的斑南市市区里找酒喝。四月份时，理查德最后进过的酒吧也禁止他入内了——可不是吗，他因为一点口角在里面大打出手，把酒吧掀了个底朝天。然后他坐了牢，酒吧也因此关门装修，两败俱伤。</p><p>即使不酗酒的时候他的名声也不好。莫里家的家庭暴力并不是个秘密：他们的邻居对于凯特琳和小梅的哭喊一点也不陌生，对于各种物品的破碎声——无论是陶瓷、玻璃，还是木头、金属，甚至还有砌墙的砖头——他们也都很清楚。小梅的四肢上经常有瘀伤，以前她用谎言唐塞过去，现在她把伤痕掩藏在衣裤或者裙子下。凯特琳曾经因为手腕骨折去过诊所，据说去时她的一只眼是青的。没有一个医生相信她所谓的&quot;跌了一跤&quot;的鬼话，但他们除了给她治疗以外，什么也做不了。凯特的左眼视力至今也没有恢复到之前的水平。</p><p>镇子里没有任何人能做任何改变：没有人有理查德·莫里家暴的确凿证据。是，小梅还是个孩子，极容易被恐吓威胁而沉默，可是凯特琳·莫里——到底是宗教信仰还是斯德哥尔摩综合征？——也不承认。三年前，小梅的祖父莱恩·莫里听说了他儿子的所作所为时，扛着板球拍从斑南南下阿尔瓦，满大街追着理查德·莫里打，铁了心要让他满地找牙。没人明白为什么最终拦下莱恩、挡在遍体鳞伤的理查德·莫里前为他求情的居然是凯特林本人。</p><p>阿尔瓦居民能尽力做的只有保证理查德·莫里永远碰不到枪。警察早在几年前就没收了他的猎枪，并且每次在大街上遇见他时总会找借口对他搜身。</p><p>小梅心地善良，这一点百合比谁都清楚。但她不理解小梅为什么在忍受多年虐待之后，依然能想到给施暴者送礼。她张嘴要说话，可是不知道该说什么、该怎么说。</p><p>&quot;他……不能算是个好爸爸吧？&quot;茱莉亚也不愿意小梅对理查德·莫里好。她试图缓解尴尬的气氛。</p><p>&quot;他从来没给过你什么礼物，是不？&quot;比起伤害小梅，兰顿更怕百合发怒。他只见过一次， 但这辈子能见一次就足够了——当时百合爆发前也像现在一样沉默。</p><p>&quot;我们只是想让你把第一份工资花在真正值得的人身上啊。&quot;麦克斯和以往一样真诚。</p><p>&quot;我——&quot;百合刚开口，所有人就想阻止她。</p><p>&quot;百合！&quot;</p><p>&quot;——就是想听听你怎么想的而已。&quot;她说。</p><p>&quot;他是我爸。没他我也活不了。&quot;小梅嘟哝道。</p><p>兰顿、茱莉亚和麦克斯在小梅和百合之间来回张望，然后互相看了一眼，心里都在想，总有一天小梅正会因为她父亲而活不了。他们忐忑不安地等着百合回答。百合只是轻轻说了一句：</p><p>&quot;对不起。&quot;</p><center>**</center><p>理查德·莫里出狱前的星期六，小梅的祖父母带着她去了斑南购物中心。虽然只是十一月的第一天，但从硕大天窗的金属支架上垂下的条幅已经预示了即将到来的折扣甩卖。整个建筑里人满为患：有把父母拖进沿路星星点点的玩具店和糖果店的孩子，有从时装店里进进出出的青少年和情侣，还有挤在过道边或者围在长凳旁的几口之家。连书店里的人都那么多，从外面望进去，书店好像变小了一样。</p><p>&quot;所有人都想提前开始感恩节购物啊。&quot;小梅心想，但周围人声喧闹，她根本听不见自己脑海里的声音，于是她想了一遍又一遍。</p><p>这是她第一次不在百合家人的伴同下来到斑南购物中心。不管百合的父母如何坚持说她就是他们家的一分子，小梅永远无法完全跨越心里的障碍，而这让她感觉自己不知感恩而又残忍。今天，她走在人群中，前方开路的是她高大的莱恩爷爷，旁边挽着的是她胖胖的戴安奶奶，没有往常同百合一家逛街时的心理斗争，这一切都令她感觉奇特又陌生。在抢眼的&quot;<strong>感恩节预热购！</strong>&quot;和&quot;<strong>CK九五折</strong>&quot;的笼罩下，小梅心想，也许这就是在另一个世界里和她的母亲一起逛街的感觉。如果她是那种性格的女孩子，她可能还会缠着母亲或者奶奶或者姥姥要某个橱窗里的某件好看的衣服或鞋子。不管怎么说，她今天至少不用躲着不敢看商场里的其他家庭了。</p><p>&quot;老天啊，简直是作孽！圣诞歌呢？&quot;戴安奶奶在小梅的耳朵旁说。&quot;记好喽，94年的时候你在十一月一号听圣诞歌。&quot;</p><p>&quot;我靠，老太太，&quot;莱恩爷爷转过身倒着走说。&quot;94年！<strong>94年</strong>——我们<strong>64年</strong>第一次约会的时候他们在万圣节前就放卡拉·托马斯了——&quot;</p><p>&quot;别听他瞎说，宝贝儿。&quot;戴安奶奶把小梅紧紧拉到身边压低嗓子说。&quot;我们六岁的时候才没约会呢。&quot;</p><p>&quot;切！梅梅，到爷爷这儿来，跟咱说，在阿尔瓦你有没有喜欢的男——&quot;</p><p>&quot;绅士点，你！给女士们开路！&quot;戴安奶奶摆摆手。</p><p>小梅感觉不好意思。她一直害怕冲突，连无关紧要的小打小闹都会躲避，但她似乎不反感她的爷爷奶奶拌嘴。这不像她的父亲醉酒后对她的母亲的大喊大叫，更像是兰顿和茱莉亚——挺可爱的。也许50年后她那两个朋友也会变成这个样子。&quot;希望他们没有一个被他们儿子虐待的孙女。&quot;她想。</p><p>天窗外湛蓝的天空里，云朵飘过冬日，天窗下，他们来到一家时装店前。</p><p>&quot;你们确定吗？&quot;小梅向店内张望，感觉有点蹊跷。店里面宽敞明亮，一排排衣架上由外向内是休闲装、职业休闲装、运动装和内衣。</p><p>&quot;确定一定以及肯定。&quot;莱恩爷爷说。&quot;我们自己的衣服就在这儿买的。&quot;</p><p>&quot;糟老头子对时尚依旧嗅觉灵敏。&quot;戴安奶奶拍了拍小梅的胳膊。</p><p>小梅不得不同意。挤满商店的大多数是紧随潮流的年轻人，小梅都不好意思看。他们喧闹着的同时夸张地挥舞着四肢——像极了时尚广告里面的模特。原来他们在这里开始让自己看上去像那么一回事。</p><p>&quot;查理的衣服我们和莱恩的一块儿买，他们穿一个尺寸。至于你，宝贝儿，我们应该也给你买件。&quot;戴安奶奶点点头。</p><p>&quot;啊？不用，你不用——&quot;</p><p>&quot;这儿我们做主，宝贝儿。&quot;</p><p>&quot;可我不会挑——&quot;</p><p>&quot;看好哪件拿哪件。你妈对于她所谓的&#39;日常着装&#39;这个概念有着很奇葩一样的理解——倒不是说她对其他的东西——&quot;</p><p>&quot;莱恩！&quot;奶奶尖声叫道。</p><p>&quot;行行行，随便挑，只要别是灰不溜秋或者&#39;简朴&#39;就行。快去快去，我们在那边等着。&quot;</p><p>&quot;爷爷好像真的不喜欢妈妈，嗯？&quot;小梅边看着一个个模特和衣架边想。&quot;妈妈到底是怎么和爸爸结婚的？&quot;她发现自己对父母一点也不了解——他们小时候是什么样、他们是怎么认识的、她的父亲是怎么变成现在这个样子的——她一无所知。也许他以前和在她旁边的那帮吵闹的高中生一样，喜欢和他的朋友和女朋友大声讲笑话，也许他和麦克斯一样，安静、真诚、关心他人，直到什么事故让他产生天翻地覆的变化——</p><p>&quot;不——不，不可能。麦克斯和他一点也不一样！&quot;</p><p>小梅对着各种衣服发愁，它们每一件都看上去太时髦，她难以想象自己把它们穿在身上的样子。茱莉亚不会有问题，每一件都像是为她准备的，百合可能会稍微挑剔一些，但她呢？南美披风大衣？复古牛仔布夹克？人造革紧腰短夹克？连带羊绒围巾和羊绒帽子的绒面大衣？</p><p>&quot;需要帮助吗？&quot;一个店员一蹦一跳地过来。小梅看着她的身材感觉脸上一热。</p><p>&quot;哦，啊——&quot;也许她直接拒绝得了。&quot;我想问一下，你们有没有——&quot;她到底应该挑什么？&quot;——大衣——&quot;大衣，嗯，挑大衣好了。哈哈，&quot;挑大一号了&quot;，哈哈哈哈。她被自己的想法逗笑了。好尴尬啊，笑成这样……。&quot;——我是说，那种比较——&quot;小梅把嘴边&quot;更适合我的那种&quot;几个字咽了下去。&quot;——呃，颜色更暗一些的大衣？&quot;呼……</p><p>&quot;颜色更暗一些的？我倒觉得亮一点的颜色和你的发色更搭啊！不喜欢吗？好吧，那就……&quot;店员姑娘挑出几件深色大衣。小梅环顾四周，想找一下爷爷奶奶。他们看到她，挤了一下眼。&quot;唉，好吧。&quot;她叹了口气，心想。</p><center>**</center><p>她的母亲最喜欢的衣服类型是毫无装饰的那种，她自己就穿着普通得不能再普通的白衬衫和灰长裙，而且不同季节里它们唯一的区别就是袖子长度和面料厚度。在家里她也会换上松垮的运动裤。她（和小梅）的衣柜里装饰最华丽的服饰可能就是那几件蕾丝镶边的衬衣了，它们怎么看都像是从19世纪油画里出来的一样。小梅觉得母亲能够忍受她选的那件带披肩的暗红色长大衣，毕竟那上面最花哨的东西可能只不过是那两排黄铜纽扣。小梅喜欢大衣的现代化复古风格和</p><p>颜色，而且当她试穿的时候，大衣虽贴身，但一点也不妨碍她移动和动作。店员姑娘说她眼光好，小梅决定还是不要去追究她是否是真心实意为好。&quot;反正穿起来挺暖和，妈妈不会说什么。&quot;她想。</p><p>至于她父亲……他周四回家的时候会穿着什么？她买的衣服会合身吗？</p><p>&quot;这座位有人没？&quot;一个小梅很熟悉的声音顽皮地问道。她猛地抬头，果然，迎接她的微笑的是百合的父亲，而站在他身边的是百合一脸笑容的母亲和百合自己。</p><p>&quot;你要坐，没人和你抢。&quot;莱恩爷爷大笑着拍着座位：&quot;来来来，赶紧坐下！&quot;</p><p>&quot;没想到会在这儿碰见你！&quot;百合抱着小梅说。她的母亲和戴安奶奶互相热情地问候。&quot;你也买了东西吗？哎，是不是你两个月前说的礼物那件事？你买了啥？&quot;小梅给她看了看。</p><p>&quot;给理查德的毛衣和厚裤子？哈，他冻不着了。&quot;百合的父亲说。</p><p>&quot;可是她自己选出来的哦！&quot;莱恩爷爷挺着胸脯，一脸骄傲。</p><p>&quot;给凯特琳的书本装订工具包？&quot;百合的母亲探过身子望着。</p><p>&quot;可是她自己选出来的哦！&quot;莱恩爷爷又挺了挺胸，还是一脸骄傲。</p><p>&quot;我都不知道她懂这么多和手工有关的东西。&quot;戴安奶奶说。</p><p>&quot;妈妈教我的。&quot;小梅没有多说。</p><p>&quot;你给自己买了什么？&quot;百合问。</p><p>&quot;啊……买了件大衣，但是爷爷奶奶付的钱——&quot;</p><p>&quot;可是她自己选出来的哦！&quot;莱恩爷爷第三次挺了挺胸，一脸骄傲。</p><p>&quot;白痴，你不会说点别的啊？&quot;戴安奶奶扇了他肩膀一巴掌。&quot;你不是还剩一些钱吗，宝贝儿？给你自己买点什么去。&quot;</p><p>&quot;拿自己的钱给我自己买点什么……听起来好陌生的话。&quot;她想。应该是话里的所有格搞的鬼——<strong>她的</strong>钱。她不可否认的是，这确实是个好主意，有种画龙点睛、任务圆满成功的感觉。再说了，她买的东西并不是特别贵，还有一大堆钱呢。</p><p>可是她已经有了件新衣服，她还需要什么？</p><p>&quot;行啊……也许我可以去看看泰迪熊……&quot;</p><p>&quot;要不然咱俩一起去买第一部手机？&quot;百合建议道。</p><p><em>手机，嗯？</em></p><p>&quot;你要是买手机的话，我们就能办家庭套餐了。&quot;莱恩爷爷说。&quot;我靠，<strong>终于</strong>可以办了。戴安，你知道咱俩现在话费得交多少不？&quot;</p><p>&quot;如果小梅真买手机的话我们得让你们两个做她的紧急联系人。真要出了事，我们从斑南跑过去可能早就晚了。&quot;戴安奶奶说。</p><p>&quot;没问题。&quot;百合的母亲点了点头。</p><p>&quot;一部手机，嗯……？&quot;小梅考虑着。她自己的手机……这样和爷爷奶奶联系会方便许多，还有就是出了事（&quot;<strong>爸爸</strong>惹了事的时候&quot;，小梅心里想）和百合一家联系也是。麦克斯也有部手机……她可以向他要电话号码。她笑了，点点头。有什么好担心的——本来就是<strong>她的</strong>钱。再说，21世纪已经过去四分之一，下一个月她将14岁，她也该离开她母亲的旧时代、加入现代社会了。</p><p><em>想想都刺激。</em></p><center>**</center><p>周四傍晚，房子的门被一把扯开，又被猛地摔上。小梅吓了一大跳，手里正在洗的盘子差点滑落。她尽力控制住颤抖的双腿，然后向身后厨房外的走廊望去。&quot;拜拜了，宁静祥和的日子。&quot;她暗暗叹了口气。&quot;我该怎么把衣服给他？&quot;她脑海里有个声音说她不想给，她的朋友们一开始的反对是正确的。</p><p>她的父亲把一只靴子&quot;咚&quot;的一声扔到地上，然后喘着粗气叽哩哇啦一阵低吼。&quot;如果踢掉一只靴子就这么费事，那他肯定已经醉的要死了。&quot;小梅心想。果然，十秒钟不到，一股酒精的恶臭向小梅这里飘来。说实话，她到底期待什么？她的父亲会在监狱里悔过自忏吗？坐牢会让他痛改前非吗？她的生活会有天翻地覆的变化吗？就小梅看来，他怎么可能不会一到家就四处找他的车钥匙，然后直奔斑南去找酒喝？又是&quot;咚&quot;的一声，理查德·莫里在走廊里过来，跺得地板震天响。</p><p>小梅做好心理准备。</p><p>理查德·莫里一点点从阴暗的走廊里进入小梅的视线。首先出现的是他垂直的平额头，在风雪和汗水的共同努力下，上面紧紧粘着他的火红头发。然后是那张粗犷凶悍的脸——他恶狠狠地皱着眉头，努力试着把一只脚摆到另一只前面。就算他们在释放他之前给他剃了须又如何，几瓶威士忌和伏特加不用一个小时就能让它们重新在他宽大的下巴和方正结实的颚骨上长出来。他的巨大的鼻子旁的一道新伤口还在流血，在他的旧伤疤中十分扎眼。今晚谁又在他的拳头下粉身碎骨？</p><p>&quot;爸爸，欢迎回家。&quot;</p><p>他弓着双肩，粗粗的脖子上的头应声转过，然后跌跌撞撞地就进了厨房。&quot;完了。完了。&quot;小梅不由得把手带着手里的盘子和海绵往身上缩。理查德·莫里伸手一把将她推开。小梅撞到冰箱上，然后顺势滑到冰箱和墙之间的角落里，对于她不小心挤出的肥皂水浑然不知。她的父亲身上地恶臭让她恶心。</p><p>&quot;妈的狗屁地方连个镜子都没了？&quot;他低吼。</p><p>&quot;这又不是厕所。走啊，走啊，&quot;小梅想，&quot;赶快走开啊！&quot;</p><p>&quot;婢养的雪。哪儿他妈都是冰。滑不拉几的。肏他娘的。&quot;他对着窗户玻璃里面的倒影搓着自己的伤口。&quot;<strong>这狗屁玩意儿怎么没用！</strong>&quot;他一拳捶在窗户上，窗户的裂痕蜘蛛网般散开。</p><p>&quot;快走啊，快走啊！幸亏妈妈自从上次就找人换上了安全玻璃。赶快走开啊……&quot;</p><p>小梅的祈祷可能真的被实现了。她的父亲和无头苍蝇一样在厨房里一顿乱撞，终于出了厨房，自始至终没看她一眼。&quot;谢天谢地，我只是被推了一下。&quot;小梅颤抖着走回水池，推开了另一扇没裂的窗。夜晚的寒风吹进，小梅打了个冷颤。与其闻她的父亲身上的恶臭，她宁肯冻着。</p><p>&quot;<strong>凯特琳！</strong>&quot;从二楼传来理查德·莫里的声音。头顶上，他的脚步越来越近。&quot;六个月之后你竟然都不出来见我了？姓柳的那帮人给你长胆了？&quot;</p><p>&quot;不，不，对不起——&quot;头顶正上方传来一声巴掌，打断了她的母亲。小梅呆住了。</p><p>&quot;老子明天就找他们算账！<strong>一个也不放过！</strong>&quot;她的父亲怒嚎。&quot;从那个小懦夫到他老婆到他家那个不要脸的小妞——&quot;他絮絮叨叨。小梅想关窗。现在已经不是恶臭和寒冷的问题了。</p><p>&quot;也许让邻居们听到他对我们能有点用。&quot;她合上窗想。&quot;但还要考虑妈妈。&quot;</p><p>&quot;——我六个月没干了！&quot;紧接着就是&quot;砰&quot;的一声。小梅听到她的母亲短促的惊叫和床垫弹簧吱嘎作响。她很清楚楼上发生了什么。她感觉难受。水龙头的流水声并盖不过楼上的声音。很快，小梅就不自觉地跑回房间、锁上了门，庆幸自己的房间在一楼的另一头。</p><p>她的书桌旁的椅子上是昨天晚上她包好的毛衣和裤子。也许她应该直接把它们扔掉，或者把它们给爷爷，或者送给麦克斯说的那种值得她送的人。</p><p>不远处传来她的母亲的微弱的呻吟。小梅翻开她借来的书，试着屏蔽掉那些声音。济慈的诗通常会立刻把她吸引进去，但今天却不行。整整两扇门和一层地板都阻止不了她听见哪怕是最微弱的她从小听到大的声音。她的母亲从来不反抗，她总是努力成为她信仰的那个&quot;好妻子&quot;的形象。&quot;我们的职责就是让丈夫快乐。&quot;她说。但她真的相信这个吗？百合的母亲从来不这么说，百合的父亲也不喝酒喝得死去活来，但他们都很幸福。&quot;那他们是不是也——？&quot;小梅紧闭双眼，为自己的想法感到羞愧。&quot;不不不，我在想什么啊？&quot;然后她不由自主地加了一句，&quot;百合还能是哪儿来的……就算他们真这样，也不是和爸爸妈妈那样。&quot;她开始听见她的父亲咒骂她的母亲的声音，仿佛是墙壁发出来的。小梅推开《济慈集》，跑进浴室洗漱。即使她洗完把自己擦干以后，她依旧感觉很脏。</p><p>她是不是应该给谁打个电话？现在还不算晚，至少她的祖父母还没睡。也许百合也没有，可能甚至连麦克斯也没有。那她该说什么？</p><p>&quot;我害怕。&quot;</p><p>怕什么？</p><p>&quot;我爸爸。&quot;</p><p>为什么？</p><p>……</p><p>和茱莉亚说可能更合适，可是她没有手机。兰顿住在茱莉亚隔壁，但他也没有手机。</p><p>&quot;真没必要买它，嗯？什么都不能改善我的生活一丁点。&quot;小梅用枕头捂住耳朵想。&quot;还不如买泰迪熊。&quot;</p><center>**</center><p>第二天五点，火车准时进入阿尔瓦站。天空灰蒙蒙的，乌云低沉，几乎要挂蹭到树梢。从车站向外往南看，阿尔瓦山坡上是层层叠叠白雪皑皑的屋顶。小梅在一扇窗前咬着牙扎头发，一遍遍解开又扎上。镜像里，兰顿地脸在她的身后冒了出来。</p><p>&quot;你都快把头发拔掉了。&quot;</p><p>&quot;不想冒那个险。&quot;小梅并不在乎她撕裂般疼痛的头皮。她的母亲早上发现她昨晚没刷完的碗之后很不高兴。既然现在她的父亲也回家了，她还是小心一点为妙，谁也别去惹。</p><p>茱莉亚跟上来，听到小梅的皮筋&quot;啪&quot;地一声缠好，表情不由得一紧，下意识地松了松自己的辫子。</p><p>&quot;你妈对你的头发严格，但也不用这样吧？咱们走之前你不是已经扎过一遍了吗？&quot;她问。小梅习惯性低头看着脚下，摇了摇头。&quot;啊，对……你爸回来了。&quot;</p><p>小梅点了点头 ，转身往车站外走。</p><p>&quot;呃……昨晚上还好吧？你给你爹礼物了吗？&quot;兰顿问 。</p><p>&quot;不想提昨晚上。&quot;小梅对着脚下嘀咕道。兰顿皱了皱眉头，不知所措。茱莉亚搂住她。</p><p>&quot;说出来说不定能好点，以前有过用不是。&quot;</p><p>小梅抬起头，她的绿眼睛看着茱莉亚清澈的蓝眼睛。昨晚她为了能告诉茱莉亚发生了什么愿意做任何事，可是现在她一点也说不出口。也许是因为兰顿在场，也许是因为她意识到谁也帮不了她。她感觉发髻变得沉重，于是又低下了头。茱莉亚停住脚步，转过小梅。</p><p>&quot;真那么严重吗？&quot;她担心地问。小梅又点了点头。&quot;那今晚你跟我回家——我和我爸妈说。你不愿意过夜的话等百合她们回家后你再过去。&quot;</p><p>&quot;我觉得着注意挺好，你和茱莉亚或者百合待着。&quot;兰顿应和道。&quot;眼不见，心不烦。或者你到我家来，我不介意睡沙发。&quot;</p><p>&quot;我也不能总是逃跑啊。&quot;小梅小声说。&quot;而且爸爸不去市区，我哪儿也去不了。&quot;</p><p>茱莉亚左右为难。如果百合在的话，她会直接把小梅拉回家，毕竟自从理查德·莫里被赶出三叶草和鹰酒馆之后，他每次晚上出门找酒喝时，百合一家总会把小梅和她的母亲接过去以避免他酩酊大醉地回来——小梅住在百合那儿会方便得多。麦克斯通情达理，他在的话也会帮上大忙，而且小梅喜欢他，他说的话小梅至少能多考虑考虑。不幸的是他们今天到大学找各自的父母了。茱莉亚也不想对自己朋友下狠手，强行把小梅拖回家。她无能为力，并为此心烦意乱，而且她并不喜欢看到小梅垂头丧气的样子。她叹着气把小梅抱在怀里，小声念着，&quot;唉，小梅，小可怜……&quot;</p><p>&quot;我没事儿。&quot;</p><p>茱莉亚挺着眉毛，拿手指把小梅的两个嘴角往上提。她从来没见过一张微笑的嘴上配着如此黯淡无助的双眼。小梅眨了眨眼，然后自己笑了起来。她挣脱了茱莉亚的怀抱。</p><p>&quot;哎，有点用。&quot;兰顿站在一边说。</p><p>&quot;谢谢，我得走了。&quot;小梅挥了挥手，转身离开。</p><p>&quot;需要我们就打电话，听见没？&quot;茱莉亚在她后面喊。&quot;给谁打都行！给我们爸妈打！手机放身上，好吗？&quot;</p><p>小梅对大地点着头，快步往破上走。她的小反抗估计是烦到茱莉亚了，因为她一般都顺从她的话，虽然有时只是为了不让她失落而假装听从。这次不一样：一堆漂亮话改变不了现实，她的母亲和她自己也一样。&quot;他为什么不打架的时候被打死或者什么的。&quot;小梅被自己的想法吓了一跳。&quot;啊，不，不……别那么想……&quot;</p><p>她转上三叶草路，过了一个路口就是主大街。左边的缓坡下，几个路口之外，和主大街相连的大路跨过铁轨弯弯蜒蜒消失在远方，最终融入去往斑南的高速公路。右边是镇子剩下的部分，一座座双层平屋顶错落有致，红色或黑色的瓦探出昨夜下的白雪。它们层层叠叠，爬坡而上，越爬越高，直到深绿色的森林边缘。再往上，小梅能隐约看到山丘顶雪下的阿尔瓦天文台的穹顶。来自路灯和窗户的点点灯火洒落在山坡上。对于小梅来说，这是最美的景象，如同群星在黑夜中降临阿尔瓦镇，把它变成了一个童话世界一般。在寒风中，如此的阿尔瓦看上去温暖、舒适、亲切。小梅一直坚信，外面卖的那些圣诞贺卡上画的就是雪下的阿尔瓦镇。</p><p><em>如果是个晴天就好了。</em></p><p>所有的一切——房屋、汽车、人、这座镇子本身——都为夜晚做好了准备。低沉的天空按着冬风在镇子上刮擦，如同用着一块破海绵擦雪一般无用。&quot;遗弃&quot;，小梅透过天然的灰色滤镜审视着眼前镇子时，脑海里浮现的只有这个词。</p><p>一辆校车在主大街上呼啸而过，小梅好奇坐校车而不是坐火车回家是什么感觉——能回到一个正常的&quot;家&quot;到底是什么感觉？跟和她的母亲一起准备去百合家过夜差不多吗？她和她们在一起的时候很开心——感觉既开心又安全，因为她知道她们不会被她的父亲的醉醺醺的声音吵醒，也不会被他当作出气筒，尽管她忘不掉她不是百合家的一员这一点——毕竟她和她们看起来一点也不一样——当然，还尽管她在她的母亲身边依旧过分矜持，无法表现自然、做她自己。</p><p>&quot;家，嗯……家，到底什么意思？&quot;她边想边穿过主大街。她小心翼翼地从未清理的雪和厚厚的冰上走过。&quot;一个有着熟悉的人的熟悉的地方？一个可以回到，甚至是可以躲藏的安全又开心的地方？&quot;她向着老酒保——九宝——的胖乎乎的妻子点头问候。老太太刚买完东西，正接着孙女回家。&quot;济慈笔下的路得站在玉米地里思念的是什么？&quot;那些作物能长到两米多，比路得那个矮小的女子高多了，更别说在她那个时代的地中海岸压根就见不到玉米。站在一片陌生植物围成的黑压压的迷宫中，思念着一个熟悉又安全的避风港——_济慈真的好厉害_——没错，那种压抑和无助，小梅再熟悉不过了。</p><center>**</center><p>小梅快要到家时，手机震动了一下。是麦克斯发来的短信。</p><p>&quot;今天没来得及问——家里还好吧，你爸爸回来了不是？&quot;</p><p>短信让她会心一笑：她真应该给<strong>他</strong>买点什么。</p><p>&quot;没事儿。我到&quot;</p><p>她犹豫了一下。</p><p>&quot;家了。一会儿再聊。&quot;</p><p>和往常一样，迎接她的是她的母亲的圣母玛丽亚画像。画家怕是想把她描绘成一个瞎子：她的双眼和死人一般，在她紧抿着的嘴上方空洞地顺着鼻子方向看去，不知道在关注什么。<strong>她</strong>到底有什么好伤心的啊？在她那个时代可能所有的女人做梦都想给上帝生一个儿子。小梅挂好大衣，不敢看她的双眼。</p><p>凯特林正在厨房准备晚饭。她穿着灰棉裙，脸色比以往更阴沉。</p><p>&quot;妈妈，我回来了。&quot;</p><p>&quot;你回得有点晚。&quot;她的母亲听上去并不生气。</p><p>&quot;对不起。&quot;小梅很清楚到底是怎么回事。</p><p>&quot;洗完手过来帮忙。&quot;</p><p>&quot;好的，妈妈。&quot;</p><p>她的母亲真爱她吗？她的母亲是在她叫了一声是抬头看了她一眼的。如果小梅在极少数的情况下切菜切到自己，凯特林总是会立刻给她包扎，也不乏温柔。在她小的时候，小梅甚至想过故意伤到自己，就为了再经历一边那种关怀。&quot;可那真的是出于爱，还是她在履行她所谓的&#39;好妻子&#39;义务？&quot;</p><p>在客厅，她的父亲四仰八叉地瘫在沙发上，沉着脸看电视。小梅站在门口，正准备脱下鞋问候他，然后她发现他穿了什么。</p><p>新毛衣和裤子正合他身。</p><p>他转过头，血丝密布的绿眼睛盯着她的清澈的绿眼睛。小梅短暂的一生中学到的第一件事就是永远不要抱有希望，但就在那一刹那，当她半蹲下，伸手解开鞋带时，她还是妄想出她的父亲生硬地说&quot;谢谢&quot;的景象。她几乎开始微笑了，然而她立刻想到那些衣服应该在她的房间里包着，而且她的母亲从来不知道它们是包起来的，也不知道它们在哪儿。他搜她的房间干什么？</p><p>&quot;唉哟。&quot;理查德·莫里低声说。小梅直起身子。&quot;唉哟哟。&quot;</p><p>&quot;爸爸我回来了。&quot;小梅下意识地说。</p><p>&quot;长翅膀了，啊？&quot;理查德·莫里嘲讽道。&quot;跟个大姑娘一样赚钱了，啊？&quot;他站起身走过来，两眼眯着。小梅打了个颤。&quot;我进去才六个月你就已经开始过没有我的日子了，啊，搞自己的金库？&quot;小梅咬着牙才能不让它们打战。厨房里，她的母亲切菜声止住了。她后退了一步。&quot;你剩下的钱在哪儿？&quot;他质问道。&quot;交出来！&quot;他喝醉了。酒气不重，但他确实是醉的。&quot;<strong>立刻给我交出来！</strong>&quot;小梅继续后退，她的父亲步步逼近。&quot;<strong>你没听见？</strong>&quot;</p><p>厨房灯照亮他凶神恶煞且布满疤痕的面孔，而小梅的脑海中突然浮现百合的脸。理查德·莫里扑向她。小梅的书包猛然落地，她转身就跑，从他的指间滑过，夺门而出。</p><p>寒冷的空气渗进她的衣服，她后悔自己没有带上大衣。快速降临的夜色让地上的冰变得难以辨别，但小梅不敢跑得太慢，她尽力踩着有雪的地方，远离更滑的冰层。当她的父亲跑出门时，她已经在第二街和三叶草路路口。是她的母亲试着拦住了他吗，还是他醉得拧不开门了？如果是后者，那他也可能在冰上滑倒——</p><p>人行道就好像被人从她的脚下抽走一样，小梅滑倒了，膝盖撞在旁边人家的铁栏杆上。她挣扎着站起身，紧接着下一秒她就感到她父亲猎靴的加固铁头踢在她的大腿上，一脚把她送到路口对面。下一秒她就被拉着发髻提了起来，结结实实地挨了一巴掌，然后又挨一巴掌，然后又是一巴掌。巴掌声震得她耳鸣，回荡在空中。她的眼前除了她父亲的脸以外什么也看不见。她试着站起来——她感觉她的头皮要被撕裂了。</p><p>&quot;<strong>这下</strong>来教育教育你！&quot;理查德·莫里咬牙切齿。&quot;<strong>这下</strong>给你的破银行！<strong>这下</strong>给你的婊子衣服！<strong>这下</strong>——&quot;</p><p>&quot;爸爸，别打了——求你了！&quot;小梅啜泣着，伸手想解开她的发髻。</p><p>&quot;<strong>把钱给我！</strong>&quot;理查德·莫里尖叫着给了她一拳。小梅感觉那一拳的冲击力仿佛拉伤了她的脖子。她从她父亲的手里飞出，先撞向旁边的石头墙，然后一头栽倒在人行道上。一辆车在一旁戛然而止，车上下来一个人，喊道：</p><p>&quot;你这在干什么？停下！&quot;</p><p>&quot;救命！帮帮我，求你了——啊！&quot;小梅眼看着她的父亲一拳打在那个人的脸上，他弹在车身上，然后滑向地面。</p><p>小梅必须起来逃走。她的脸在流血，额头、大腿和膝盖如火燎般疼痛。她艰难起身，理查德·莫里也动身要追，但回头把抱在腿上的那位车主踢开。他看见他的女儿踉跄地穿过马路，于是大步走过去。</p><p>&quot;来人阻止理查德·莫里啊！快来人！&quot;那位车主挣扎着要站起来，大喊着。理查德·莫里低吼一声，又回过头朝他走去。</p><p>一阵短暂的对峙之后，那人的脸上挨了理查德·莫里一脚，不省人事。</p><p>小梅在离对面的人行道还有几步的时候踩空了。她瘫倒在地，因为寒冷和疼痛浑身发抖。她刚才倒地的时候肯定伤到了头，现在眼前天旋地转，她分不清她在往哪而走。她最终还是往前爬：移动意味着提高存活机率——</p><p>她的父亲凭她的毛衣把她抓起来，然后和扔布偶一样把她摔在地上。</p><p>&quot;你为什么这么恨我？&quot;她脱口而出。</p><p>&quot;我来告诉你为什么！&quot;她父亲又向她的背上踹了一脚，她痛苦的尖叫着倒下。</p><p>&quot;差不多了。&quot;她感觉自己要冻死了。她感觉自己粉身碎骨。再爬起来需要她所没有的巨人般的力气。&quot;我就到此为止了。&quot;她在路中央蜷缩成一团，咬牙等死。</p><p>她已经记不清这一切是怎么开始的了。她的父亲踢她、打她、锤她、扔她，而她在断断续续地想她到底是不是他的女儿。一直是这样的吗？以前有过她已经忘记的更幸福的日子吗？她对她父亲的记忆里只有恐惧。在支离破碎的思想间她喊着她的母亲，可是她真的在喊谁？绝对不是凯特林·莫里。</p><p>她父亲的怒吼早就变得难以理解。为什么没人从家里出来帮她，只有那位从车里出来的先生尝试了，然后失败了？&quot;当然了……一辆车又不是一个家。&quot;她想。&quot;家里多安全，没有哪个白痴会为了我抛弃它的。我。哈哈。我。理解路得思念家。搞笑。没家。&quot;</p><p>她已经感觉不到自己身体，也感觉不到她父亲的击打了。她的身体内有多少根断骨？有多少器官破裂？还剩几口气？&quot;快杀了我啊。&quot;她躺在那里，脑海里只有这一个想法，她的红发围绕身体散开，在路灯下如血一般。</p><p>&quot;妈妈连试着拦住他都没有。她从来没有。&quot;</p><p>在她脑海深处，一个记忆——更像是一个梦——挣脱了束缚：温暖，回荡着安眠曲，洋溢着清新慰藉的气息；一双充满爱意的手拍着她入睡。</p><p>一声小梅已经听不见的撕心裂肺的尖叫粉碎了这一切。理查德·莫里的下一脚并没有与她接触，一个东西——一个人紧紧裹在她身上。随着一阵剧痛，她和那个记忆一起消逝了。</p><center>**</center><p>麦克斯把假发梳得如丝绸一般，发丝垂过小梅的肩膀，落在她自己的头发散开时的地方。他把梳子还给茱莉亚，然后举起一面镜子。</p><p>&quot;好了。怎么样？&quot;</p><p>&quot;谢谢。&quot;</p><p>麦克斯看见她的脸浮现出表情，自己也笑了。她的表情只是嘴角微微一抬——这是她醒后第一次如此——仿佛她在藏着它，和他记忆中的一样。兰顿倚着墙，双手抱胸，说：</p><p>&quot;漂亮。&quot;</p><p>茱莉亚把一缕头发绕到小梅耳后，说着：</p><p>&quot;没多久它们就又长出来了。&quot;</p><p>斑南城市医院的医生为了缝合她头上的伤，剃掉了小梅的头发。这让两周之前刚醒来时的她和来第一次看望她时的朋友们大吃一惊。她是怎么挺过来的？小梅听说她被送来时情况糟糕透了，身上有数处骨折和内部出血。他们需要通过一系列手术把她实实在在地拼起来补好。即使是现在，她的头和身体大部分还被绑带层层缠绕，和床边的各种仪器通过电线和导管相连。她的右臂打着石膏，虽然左臂没有，但她无法用左手平稳地拿住物品。至于她的腿，明天还有场手术，而且在那之后还有更多场为了她的其他身体部分的手术。她什么也做不了，连清洗自己都做不到。她感觉自己又丑又脏。</p><p>&quot;你真是历经磨难。&quot;兰顿说。&quot;你很强的。我很庆幸你活着，小梅。&quot;</p><p>小梅没有回答。<strong>她</strong>应该感到庆幸吗？过去几个夜晚，在她破碎的记忆重新浮现并自我拼接、修复时，小梅在噩梦里一遍又一遍地重新经历了那个傍晚。她已经害怕睡觉了。每天晚上，她从窗帘的缝隙间望向窗外，直到她迷迷糊糊地睡过去，然后惊醒，身旁是滴滴作响的心电图，有时眼前还是值班护士的面孔。她不敢问任何人自己什么时候能完全康复——甚至她能不能完全康复。未来对于她来说没有任何光明，无论如何，她最后还是要回到她的阴郁的家。是，她父亲因为这次可能又坐了牢，但他总得出来。到那时，一切又重新开始了，她母亲也不会阻止他。&quot;我醒来之后也没再见到过她。&quot;小梅想。她从来不知道生气是什么感觉，她只感到孤独、被抛弃，尽管她的朋友们在她的床边。</p><p>病房门被滑开，护士端着她的午饭走了进来。</p><p>&quot;我们来吧。&quot;麦克斯双手接过盘子，脸在他姜红色的卷发下发烫。&quot;谢谢。&quot;</p><p>&quot;不不不，该说谢谢的是我。&quot;护士答道，然后转向小梅，&quot;等会儿还有一些来看你的人，小梅。我好像看到你妈妈了。&quot;</p><p>&quot;那我猜最好还是<strong>我</strong>来吧，可不能让凯特林瞎想。&quot;茱莉亚朝麦克斯挤了下眼。</p><p>麦克斯羞涩地笑着把盘子递了过去。</p><p>&quot;张嘴，小梅，啊——嗯……嗯。&quot;兰顿说着，倾过身子瞄着茱莉亚把一勺稀饭吹凉，然后喂给小梅。&quot;我猜那就是说她终于出院了——&quot;</p><p>&quot;快吃哟！&quot;茱莉亚哄着小梅，声音不必要的大。她一勺接着一勺喂过去，就像是为了阻止小梅问兰顿说的是什么意思。</p><p>病房门被猛地滑开。</p><p>百合拄着拐杖站在门口，喘着粗气。她抬头环视明亮的房间，然后以最快的速度一瘸一拐地走了进来，跳过最后几米。茱莉亚和麦克斯及时躲开了。百合扔下拐杖，扑到小梅身上。小梅狠狠吸了一口气，脸上痛苦地一紧。</p><p>&quot;啊！对不起。&quot;百合一只脚站着，嘟哝道。&quot;真对不起。&quot;</p><p>&quot;看样子你不用轮椅了。&quot;兰顿说。</p><p>&quot;也是时候了。&quot;百合在床沿背对着小梅和茱莉亚坐下。她快速瞟了小梅的胳膊一眼，然后伸手紧紧抓着她的石膏。</p><p>&quot;怎么了？&quot;小梅问。&quot;你没事吧？&quot;百合沉默不语，小梅转向他人。&quot;怎么回事？&quot;</p><p>茱莉亚、兰顿和麦克斯互相看了看，犹豫起来。百合看着地板，一言不发。小梅看见她的脖子后面一道原先被黑马尾遮挡住的、刚愈合的伤痕。门外，百合的母亲出现了。在她身后，小梅看见她自己苍白虚弱的母亲。&quot;百合？&quot;她悄声问道。&quot;告诉我，好吗？&quot;</p><p>&quot;你感觉怎么样，亲爱的？&quot;百合的母亲进来吻了一下小梅。</p><p>&quot;百合怎么了？&quot;小梅问。</p><p>&quot;我摔了一跤！求你了！&quot;百合央求道。她和她的母亲互相看了好久。小梅看不到她的朋友的脸，但她的母亲显然很矛盾。凯特林走到角落里坐下，离小梅的床远远的。茱莉亚、兰顿和麦克斯决定忙起来，继续喂小梅剩下的午饭。</p><p>&quot;千万别多虑，小梅。&quot;百合的母亲开始说道。&quot;她只是不想让你怪自己。看到你那天晚上经历的也让她不是很舒服。&quot;百合蜷起腿，紧紧闭上眼睛。&quot;她帮你挡住了理查德的攻击。&quot;</p><p>&quot;我们一到家，妈妈就收到了你的紧急电话。&quot;百合模糊的声音传来。小梅一脸疑惑。&quot;你在喊救命——你的手机能识别出来。电话很快就断了。我猜是你的手机坏了。&quot;</p><p>&quot;因为我跌倒了吗？啊，我的手机……用了才不到两个周。&quot;小梅想。</p><p>&quot;然后我就向你家跑去。&quot;百合突然止住，她的母亲把手放在她的头上。</p><p>&quot;应该就在那时候她看见的你，然后扑到你身上的。&quot;</p><p>&quot;我跑在爸妈前。我记得后来爸爸控制住了理查德·莫里。&quot;</p><p>&quot;百合刚好及时赶到。&quot;她的母亲说。&quot;他最后的几次攻击特别猛烈，打折了她的盆骨和腿。附近的邻居应该是报了警。我们找到了那个受伤的人，然后把百合和他送到了阿尔瓦医院。你的情况太严重了，所以被送到了这儿。&quot;</p><p>小梅发现她的母亲坐在椅子，目不转睛地盯着地板。这不会是她第一次听这个故事吧？那位从车里下来的先生和百合都为她挺身而出，挡住了她父亲的拳头，而她母亲从一开始就似乎没做什么。</p><p>&quot;谢谢。&quot;小梅把胳膊移向百合，百合又重新抓紧她的石膏。&quot;对——&quot;</p><p>&quot;我做了个选择而已。&quot;百合对着自己的膝盖低沉地说。&quot;那个人也是。&quot;</p><p>&quot;没有什么比给自己父亲买礼物更正常的，尽管那个决定可能会带来一些不良后果。&quot;百合的母亲说。&quot;除了理查德，这件事中没有任何人犯错。&quot;</p><p>门第三次滑开，百合的父亲走了进来，一脸不高兴——他看上去甚至有些可怕。他环顾四周。</p><p>&quot;大家都在这儿。你怎么样了，小梅？假发挺好看的。&quot;他对着她和她的朋友们快速地笑了笑，然后对他的妻子说：&quot;莱恩和戴安对消息的反应<strong>一点也不好</strong>，说我应该早点告诉他们。&quot;</p><p>&quot;那我们也没办法，总不能让他们在小梅昏迷的时候闯进来。&quot;她说。&quot;听证会呢？&quot;</p><p>&quot;凯特得做个决定，刻不容缓。&quot;小梅从来没有见过他如此严肃。&quot;下个周是节假日，法院一直到一月份才开门。等理查德进去之后只能更麻烦。&quot;百合放下腿，和她的父母一样转向凯特林。其他人和小梅一样困惑。&quot;我不该这么逼你，但真的很抱歉，已经过去够久了。你必须做个选择，你的神还是你的女儿。&quot;</p><p>麦克斯是第一个明白的，但茱莉亚是第一个敢说出来的：</p><p>&quot;你要离婚吗？&quot;</p><p>小梅听到她的母亲颤抖地吸了一口气，原来她一直都在那里落泪，而且可能从坐下时就开始了。这是小梅第一次看到她的母亲哭。</p><p>&quot;对不起。我没那么勇敢——&quot;凯特林哭着说。</p><p>&quot;你能考虑离婚这件事就已经很勇敢了。你们说呢？&quot;百合的父亲问孩子们。</p><p>&quot;必须的。&quot;兰顿说。茱莉亚和麦克斯点头同意。</p><p>&quot;再说了，你眼都没眨一下就给小梅献了你身上近一半的血，还有你的骨髓。要是这还不勇敢，那我真不知道什么叫勇敢。&quot;他两臂交叉抱在胸前。小梅终于明白为什么她的母亲面色苍白。他对她说：&quot;对，她自己也是刚刚出院。宝贝儿，你失血太多了。&quot;</p><p>百合的母亲走过去，蹲在凯特林弯曲的身体前，把手搭在她的胳膊上。</p><p>&quot;凯特，你已经做了决定了，是不是？你只需要鼓起勇气说出来。&quot;</p><p>&quot;他要是回来报复怎么办？&quot;</p><p>&quot;那我们会在你身边。&quot;</p><p>凯特林吸了下鼻子，点点头。</p><p>&quot;我离。&quot;</p><p>百合的母亲松了口气，舒心地笑了。百合的父亲吹了个口哨。</p><p>&quot;棒！那我们下午就去签字。被小梅的爷爷奶奶骂了一顿之后再听到这个简直轻松了好多。话说，我闺女这是咋了？&quot;百合的父亲笑了。</p><p>&quot;她睡着了。&quot;小梅说。</p><p>&quot;这么块？我猜她终于能睡个好觉了。她每天晚上都做噩梦梦见你。当时真的看起来不妙……&quot;他捡起百合的双拐依靠到床边，然后蹲下平视小梅的眼睛。他至此严肃的表情舒展开来。&quot;你很强的，小梅。不知道你怎么想，但我和庆幸你活着。&quot;</p><p>&quot;我就是说嘛！&quot;兰顿伸了个懒腰。&quot;你看，都这么说。&quot;</p><p>&quot;想不到吧！&quot;百合的父亲伸手越过病床和兰顿碰了碰拳头。&quot;谁要吃午饭？来啊，孩子们。艾瑞思？凯特？&quot;</p><p>&quot;你去吧。&quot;凯特林对百合的母亲说。她点头起身，和他们一起离开了。</p><p>窗外飘着雪，病房内也同样安静。小梅躲着她母亲，不想看她，转而盯着床沿上驼着背睡觉的百合发呆。&quot;她怎么能保持那个姿势那么久？&quot;她刚想完，百合就开始摇晃，然后栽倒在床上继续睡。小梅端详着百合的脖子。她先前看到的那个伤痕只是众多中的一个，百合也被缝了好几针。</p><p>她得以幸存，全是因为百合和那位车里的先生。也许还有她母亲。对，有她的母亲。看来至少对于他们来说，一切都会有好的结局，然而小梅还是感觉缺少了什么。</p><p>凯特林费力把她的椅子搬到小梅的床边，打断了她的思绪。她坐下盯着小梅的手腕。&quot;嗯？&quot;小梅看着她。</p><p>&quot;理查德被拘留了，我觉得我应该让你知道。&quot;凯特林张口说，声音沙哑。&quot;那个帮助你的人是个刚下班的警察，我不知道这个会不会在考虑范围内。&quot;</p><p>&quot;哦。&quot;小梅终于说道，然后心想：&quot;不对，不是这个……&quot;</p><p>&quot;你能原谅我吗？&quot;凯特林又试着开口，她几乎有点害怕。&quot;原谅我不是一个好母亲吗？&quot;小梅抬头注视着她母亲的大眼睛。看起来她在过去的一个月里也经历了许多。通常，在她的眼里除了恐惧以外很难找到其他的情感。&quot;我太害怕他了，我一直不敢阻止他。你能原谅我吗？&quot;</p><p>&quot;我不知道。这也不是缺失的那个东西。&quot;小梅想着，转而问道：&quot;做骨髓移植的时候，你害怕吗？&quot;</p><p>&quot;那是她应该的。&quot;旁边传来百合困倦的声音。小梅吓了一跳，她什么时候醒的？&quot;你得赢得她的原谅。&quot;她翻了个身，双腿耷拉在床边，睡眼惺忪地看着凯特林。</p><p>百合说话是出了名的直率，有时甚至尖锐，但小梅看到她对一个大人这样说话还是感到意外。她看到她的母亲全心全意地、顺从地低下头以后，更加吃惊。百合叹了口气，伸手甩过一支胳膊搂在小梅身上。小梅因为疼痛表情一紧，百合又睡了过去。</p><p>&quot;妈妈，我书包里有个蓝纸包着的东西。&quot;小梅小声说道。&quot;给你的。我希望我扔下包的时候它没被摔坏。&quot;</p><p>&quot;等你回家的时候我们一起打开。至于现在——&quot;她犹豫了一下。</p><p>她的母亲在她的额头上留下的吻迟到太久了。</p><p><em>好了。</em></p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>我们眼前是一扇门，门外是舞台。舞台上紧闭的是深红色天鹅绒幕布，而在幕布外的——我们知道——是所有幕布外的东西。我站在小梅的椅子旁，看她仿佛在嚼自己的嘴唇。</p><p>“马上就到时间了。”我和她说。“你没事吧？”</p><p>“有点事。”她转朝我，大大的绿眼睛里满是焦虑。“我的还算体面吧？”她穿着一件白色羊绒衫和一条白色羊毛裙坐在带垫子的椅子上，脚上的类军靴只有鞋尖触地。她特别讨厌高跟鞋，所以靴子的鞋跟并没有多高。我知道莱恩看了肯定会强挺胸膛骄傲地说：“全是她自己挑的！”这一身确实全是她自己挑的。她的火红色的头发也不是平时她的妈妈逼着她盘的紧紧的发髻，而是她特别喜欢的百合一家教给她的皇冠头。</p><a id="more"></a><p>我看了我自己：上衣是右袖口开了线、左肘封了毛线补丁的红色手织毛衣，毛衣下露出了里面的蓝白格子杉；裤子是折痕处表面布料成块脱落的直筒牛仔裤；鞋是去年冬至就该洗了的运动鞋。我的在全谱灯的照耀下染了一层红色的黑发已经长得无法利索地打理，但也不足以扎起来，更别说我昨晚还没洗头。</p><p>“我觉得我应该问这个。”我紧张地笑了笑。她也咯咯地笑了。</p><p>“我看你挺好的啊。”</p><p>“那你也挺好的。”</p><p>然后我们就不说话了。她以往一样看着自己膝盖，我看着门。</p><p>“这几个周……过得真是……”过了一会儿，她开口说道。“我被迫回一起我不想去回忆的东西。”</p><p>“对不起。”我说。“我也想起了一些我宁可忘掉的东西。”</p><p>“看来咱俩没那么不一样。”</p><p>“嗯，是那样。”我深吸一口气。“你看，你和百合、比利和艾瑞斯——你们几个每个人都有一些我有的品质。把你们展现出去就像是把我自己展现出去一样，有的时候我对自己说出去的东西和说的方式得格外小心。你的感受我都能理解。”</p><p>“嗯。”她抬头看我。“所以说，你……你以前也——？”</p><p>“没有你那么严重，也没有你那么频繁。我真的对不起你啊，让你经历那些事。”我又深吸一口气。“但你很坚强啊，你挺过来了，而且我记得你一次也没有哭过。”我对她笑着说，“比我强多了。”</p><p>“也不全是我啊，还有别的东西帮我的，比如——”她也给我回了个笑容，“比如我们不能说的那些。没有它们我不可能痊愈——啊不，要不是艾瑞斯，我可能连医院都撑不到……”她的声音越来越小。</p><p>“嗯对，我们不能提起那个东西，还是留给他们想像算了，也能让我少遭点麦格林先生的白眼。”</p><p>“这整个过程中你最喜欢哪部分？”</p><p>“除了写文章改文章？”我撇了下嘴。“呃……应该是商场那块吧？我喜欢济慈那部分。简直天才。<em>你是</em>个天才。济慈是个天才。”</p><p>“有时候你真没必要在写的时候克制自己的影响。”</p><p>“嗯，你说得对。你呢？你最喜欢哪一段？”</p><p>“去商场。”她看起来有点不好意思。“哎，既然周围没人……我还喜欢麦克斯和茱莉亚喂我那段。哎呀我在说什么……”她捂起眼睛,“……还有——还有妈妈第一次亲我的时候。”</p><p>“至少是你知道的她第一次亲你的时候。”我转头看向别处。“听我说吭……让你经历那些事我真的深感抱歉。你真的不应该被那么对待。”</p><p>“反正是我爸爸的错。”她不再多说。然后她把手从眼睛上拿开，一脸严肃。“他在那之前什么样？还是他一直就是那个样？”</p><p>“我还真不知道。”小梅这么一问，我也开始好奇。“一个来自明显正常、和睦家庭的暴力酒鬼，而且即便不喝酒也暴力……问题是这个：我一般不去考虑深度了解我不喜欢的角色。——啊，得跟你说清楚，反过来不成立吭。我也不知道你的妈妈以前啥样。”</p><p>“神也不是他们说的那样无所不知的，嗯？”</p><p>“我从来就不是神啊！”我大笑道。</p><p>“你干这个多久了，展现别人的故事？”</p><p>“好久好久了。但单说这个舞台？五年吧？当时脑子一抽跑到这儿，然后就决定留这儿了。我大半夜到的这里，然后发现，‘哎，正好冬至。也许我应该每年都来干一场。’呃，一开始我想的是给我的朋友们写，然后我发现我好像没那么多朋友。在然后我反应过来，我没必要做给别人看——不管每年找合适的人、合适的经历、合适的语言、甚至合适的观众有多难——我自己总是搞得挺开心。第一年我找到的实际上是比利和艾瑞斯。我因为拉出来一个和我特别像的人被别人嘲笑了半天，你知道吗？他们以为是我在意淫我自己……但只有正儿八经的艺术家知道该怎么看待这个事。你肯定知道。”小梅笑着点了点头。“然后我又带他们上了一次台，接着又上了一次。有时我想，干脆我就一直找他们得了。你猜怎么着？我找到了其他人，你应该不认识。”</p><p>“嗯？”</p><p>“一个老头和他的狗。呃，他的机器人。外形是条狗。反正我觉得那应该是我目前为止最好的一次选择，差点拿了个地方奖项，但我估计我可能真的没那么好。然后就是去年了。那次，嗯……我喜欢他们俩，威廉和林赛。我习惯找像我的人，有时他们甚至和我一个姓。我也不知道怎么看这事。”</p><p>“要我说，你要是无所谓的话就没关系啊。”</p><p>“小梅你是真的善良哇。”</p><p>“继续说啊，分散一下我的注意力——”她指了指那扇门。</p><p>“嗯。那个——他们其实是我梦见的，也和狗有关。我专门咨询了一下麦格林先生，他给我他平时那一套激烈矛盾跌宕起伏的阴暗情节。我把它们尽量加进去。然后放了出去。评价有好有坏，我也不是太信。一个挺厉害的编辑比较委婉地回复我，说：‘有点兴奋不起来’，可咱俩都很清楚他说的啥，是不，‘你的故事无聊透顶，哪个傻逼喜欢你去找哪个傻逼。’”</p><p>小梅拍了拍我的胳膊，安慰我。</p><p>“今年可能更差呢。谁知道啊。”我嘟囔道。</p><p>“可你喜欢做这件事啊。”</p><p>“是。”</p><p>“那不就行了嘛。”</p><p>门这时候开了，小梅和我吓了一跳。一个身披斗篷的人走了进来：“世界的主持人”——这是小梅给他起的名字。</p><p>“嘿，你，对，就你。”他指着我。“你和小梅，你们两人做好准备。这扇门再打开的时候你们两人就该上场了。啊对，你，”他又指了指我，“好好弄弄你的头！”</p><p>“少逼逼我的头！”我冲他吼。“老子正月不出不会弄的！还有，我他妈的有个名字，谢谢！”</p><p>然而他早就甩门而出了。小梅看着我，一脸怪笑：既在笑我和他之间的对话，又在愁那伙计的消息。</p><p>“好，好。”我深呼吸。我咬了下嘴唇。我在小梅的椅子旁边蹲下。“好。”打气，给她和我打气。“好。我们这两周很辛苦，我们睡得很晚，我们自我怀疑，我们因为写得好的部分自我鼓励，我们因为想起那些事几乎崩溃。整个作品我们过了三次，多多益善，是不是？我们努力做了最好。我们坚强又牛逼，按时完成了它。是吧？是吧。</p><p>“即使五年了我还是不知道外面等着的是什么。我们付出那么多努力，外面可能一个人也没有。外面也可能站着一大群人等着骂我们——”</p><p>“他们针对我怎么办？说我是玛丽苏怎么办？”</p><p>“我知道的是玛丽苏从来没经历过你所经历的生活。玛丽苏从她诞生那一刻就是个傻逼，但玛丽·安，你，小梅，你是个天使，好吧？好吧。如果你叫我神，那你就是天使——别和我争。再说了，他们要是针对你，我就和百合护着你一样护着你。我——我也骂回去。嗯……对，我也骂回去……”我对自己重复了一遍。“没错，我护着你。”</p><p>“对不起，我没法同样护着你……”她忽然垂头丧气。</p><p>“别这样，你在这儿让我开心我就很知足了。你、百合、比利、艾瑞斯、茱莉亚、兰顿、纳菲亚斯，还有其它我领上台展现过的人——所有人。真的超好的，我——我——”</p><p>“喏……”</p><p>小梅跳下椅子紧紧抱住了我。我闭紧双眼让它随便流淌。</p><p>“我真的很对不起你，让你经历那些事。”我又说了一遍。“而且刚才我好像是要安慰你的。”</p><p>“我害怕。”她看着我的眼说。“你也是，嗯？”</p><p>“每次都是。”</p><p>“但这次是你第一次和你要带上台的人谈起这些事。”</p><p>“也是第一次记下来谈话内容。所以我估计这次算很特殊吧。”</p><p>“更能承受？”</p><p>“嗯。我们是一伙的。”</p><p>“嗯。”</p><p>我鼓起勇气，小梅也是。</p><p>“玛丽·安·莫里。”我说。</p><p>“柳翰文恒。”她说。</p><p>“轮到我们了。”我们互相点了点头。</p><p>门被推开，然后世界的主持人——有人叫他“时间”，我叫他“命运”——可怜人，真心的可怜，过了那么久只剩下一副斗篷包着的骨头。我每次见到他的时候我都想把他砸个粉碎，再让他折磨我！——你知道吗，人们甚至不知道他是不是真的是男的？也许他是个女的，也许他和秀丽线虫一样是雌雄同体，青岛话里的<em>二异子</em>，也许他没有性别——但我跑题了。小梅嘴里的世界的主持人招了招他的骨头手，说，</p><p>“快！快！冬至到了！”他给我们扶着门。</p><p>我站起身，向小梅伸出一只手。她双眼湿润，笑着握住了我的手。</p><p>“要勇敢，要坚强。”</p><p>我们两个人的瘦小身躯穿过门，门外是沉默的鹅绒幕布。这里又安静又黑。我们能听见我们的心跳声。我们站着，等着，大手拉着小手，然后我们的手开始出汗。</p><p>“哎呀。”小梅和我相视一笑。</p><p>幕布毫无征兆地开启，我们满眼是耀眼的光。</p><p>来了。</p><p>轮到我们了。</p><p>“你好，世界。”我们说。</p>]]></content>

      <title>The Boys who Climbed</title>

      <url>/2019/12/27/The%20Boys%20who%20Climbed/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>For my friends: Gou Xi (苟昔) and King of Clubs (黑桃K), who inspired, encouraged, and aided me on my climb up the literary hill.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>This is a fable, and the first story I wrote in Chinese in six years. I was never good at writing in my mother tongue after 4th grade, and thus the original Chinese version was rather a disaster, though I did my best to revise it. With my stories getting longer and longer, it’s refreshing to have something short like this. I hope my English translation here does the original Chinese version justice, and that neither version offends my friends back home.</p></blockquote><a id="more"></a><p>There was a village surrounded by mountains. Though there were tunnels connecting the village to the outside world, due to their long distances, burrowing through the mountains and underground, when watched from their exits, the mountains around the village would have been long merged with the horizon. Very few villagers thus knew a thing about the mountains: not their heights, not the time it took to scale them, not the sceneries or the views within and atop from them, not even whether they were a single mountain or part of a mountain range.</p><p>Three boys grew up in different parts of the village, unknown with each other, and shared a common curiosity and yearning toward the mountains. In their early days they liked to stand by the doors of their homes and stare at the mountains, stretching their necks and straining their eyes hoping to catch even a glimpse of the peaks. The boys could often be found beside the few mountain climbers, watching them as they prepare for the climb or listening to their stories in the mountains when they came down at dusk. The climbers and their stories frequented the boys’ dreams. When a few years passed and the boys were old enough, they started to tag along. They were not fast climbers, nor could they reach decent heights, but they enjoyed the experience, honing their skills with every climb. Each boy followed a different climbing group, so their techniques and skills differed somewhat.</p><p>Resting spots dotted the mountainside: those were the pavilions built beam-by-beam by climbers of past generations, connecting and serving as the crossroads of trails wide and narrow, forming a sparse web that covered the mountains. Each trail varied in difficulty, and reaching one pavilion might be a harder achievement than reaching some others at similar altitudes. The pavilions thus became proofs of mountaineering skills and social spots of climbers similar in skill. Every climber who reached a pavilion that was the most difficult to reach among the same altitudes, regardless of their age, would be hailed as equals and congratulated by those resting within. The climbers would rest, eat, or chat in the pavilions, and some would even use it as a base, where they’d meet up to challenge higher altitudes.</p><p>It was one of these pavilions where the three boys made acquaintance of each other.</p><p>It was Qingming, the day for spring outings and tomb-sweeping. The sky was clear and bright, and many villagers picnicked on the grasslands by the foot of the mountains. The three boys saw the broad mountainside and the towering peaks in the bright sunshine and none could resist the call. Each of them took leave from their families and stepped onto their nearest trails with food and water on their backs. In pure coincidence they arrived at the same time in a pavilion that was known as the first hurdle for novices. A number of others were in the pavilion, too, and they greeted the boys, hollering them over. They sat together, taking in the view and their food, and talked about whatever came to their minds.</p><p>In the rabble of laughter and chatter someone asked about everyone’s reason for climbing. One said that it was the parents: they couldn’t scale the mountains in their youths due to either health issues or family problems or everyday life, so they placed that wish upon their children. Another said that climbing the mountains was promising and would bring good prospects: sure, there were tunnels, but just shut one’s eyes on a horse or a donkey or a carriage or a car and then one’d be out of it without doing anything; climbing out over the mountains, though, required skill and effort, and it was itself an admirable act. Yet another said that mountain-climbing offered opportunities: one could discover curious and rare fauna and flora and minerals while in the mountains, not to mention sceneries and views worth painting and photographing, and all of these could be traded for a pretty penny both in- and outside the village. One of the three boys piped up, and said that he climbed the mountains merely because he loved them. The mountain was an escape from the onerous and monotonal village life, and it would serve as the best badge of honor and glory if he climbed to the top and out of the village. Besides, he added, he was somewhat a natural at this, and since the hobby didn’t get in the way of his house chores and errands, why not?</p><p>The other two boys found themselves thinking along similar lines, and struck up a conversation with him after people dispersed.</p><p>They became climbing companions. Sometimes they would chat during climbing or resting, discussing the merits and meanings of mountain climbing, the things happening at home or in the village, the differences between other pavilions at the same altitude and the one they frequented as their base, or praising or complaining about some random expert or newbie in either their or another pavilion. More often than not they just walk in a row or side-by-side without a word, pointing out the way on or some new landmarks, giving each other a hand from time to time.</p><p>Though the three boys shared a general understanding towards climbing, there were nuances between them. The first boy took climbing as a distraction, a leisure activity. He loved looking down upon the village at his feet or looking out at the distant mountain ranges from the mountainside or the edge of a cliff. The views gave him grand, torrential thoughts and powerful, suffocating emotions. If he happened to be in love, he would sing. His companions would listen, marveling at his unending liveliness and the energy his songs instilled in them. The second boy loved the mysteriousness the mountains held. From where the spring waters ran to where the caves led, what lay in the woods and where the strange birds and beasts some other climbers spotted were – they all fascinated him. He had to see and hear the strange and the weird, and try his utmost best to solve them, just to prove himself and gain honor and respect from his peers and the other villagers. At times the trio would change their direction because of his curiosity, and head down trails that led to the unknowns (which might not be paths to the higher altitudes as they had hoped). The third boy’s thoughts were in the clouds more often than not. He considered his village life a bore, providing little outlet for his imaginations. Repetitive and onerous daily chores and errands exploited his attention every minute. In the mountains, as long as he could stand firm and walk swift and light, the boredom and the annoyance from the village would never catch up. He would sometimes become unaware of his surroundings and take the most unrealistic routes just to show off his skills, immersing, wholehearted, in the fantasies the mountains provided. His companions were all too familiar with his daydream wanderings and ceased to make a deal of it: he never tripped or fell, anyways.</p><p>The boys forged a tacit understanding between themselves, and shared joy through their journeys. They spent longer and longer times together in the mountains, reaching increasing altitudes and developing their climbing skills with every trip. Their equipment upgraded from the earliest DIYs to entry gears sold in village shops to amateur sets imported from outside. As with many other climbers, the mountains became part of their body, their speech, themselves.</p><p>One day, two of the boys realized that the other boy was starting to climb less and less frequently, until they stopped seeing him on their trips. Whenever they met him in the village, they would talk about the mountain and ask him when he’d be climbing with them again, and his answer would always be, “One day or another.” Some years after when one of the boys would finally decide to ask him why he stopped climbing, he would answer, “I don’t have the mood for it anymore after I moved. The road into the mountains was closer by before moving.” What he never said was that on the day they reached a pavilion at a certain altitude, the first thing he did when he got home was to throw every piece of his climbing gear into the fire stove, and then he smashed the stove into smithereens. The pieces of broken steel and the ashes of his gear were dumped onto the garbage truck at the crossroad, waiting to head out of the mountains the next day. No one other than his family knew.</p><p>The second and the third boy still climbed together, heading again and again for higher pavilions. One day, just as they were close to the next pavilion, they had to head back down due to the time. At the foot of the mountain, they promised to continue tomorrow. The second boy arrived home with nothing else on his mind other than the satisfaction and praises he’d get when he reaches the next pavilion, but what greeted him was the stern faces of his parents. They told him to stop this mountaineering business: “There are too much work in our house that needs your help. Besides, it’s time for you to learn a decent craft for a living – climbing mountains isn’t going to feed you! A handful of people climb the mountains, and why should the glories and the honors be for you? Do you really need to go into the mountains? Aren’t there enough mysteries in the village alone? Wouldn’t others admire you more if you mastered a noble craft and made a living out of that?” With his bitter and repeated pleadings he managed to obtain his last chance to climb: he was to get to that next pavilion. He studied techniques of mountaineering, calculated times for different routes, and analyzed again and again the climbing recordings of past mountaineers and pored over and over their mountaineering journals. The third boy also tried to challenge that pavilion on his own during this time. Though he inched closer to it with every attempt, he always returned fruitless. As the second boy finally finished his preparations, he hit the third boy up for the last time. He dragged his friend over to every spot that he had wanted to but never had the time to see. They strode through every forest and woods, followed along every river and stream, and cleared out every cave and cavern. Before sunset, the two of them finally reached the place they had craved for so long. The pavilion was the first one that belonged to the upper altitudes, and it was the biggest pavilion and hosting the most resting climbers they had seen so far. The others greeted them with warmth and high-fives, pulling and ushering them in. They invited them to join their meal and stay in the camp overnight, egging them on for stories of their way up. They talked long into the night. The coming day saw the second boy heading down the mountain to fulfill his promise to his parents, out of which he learnt a decent craft for a living. He did consider becoming a climber again. His equipment was not outdated, and his skills had not rusted, but it was the unexpected hustle and bustle that took him by unawares. He finally didn’t have the time or the mood to climb, either.</p><p>The third boy climbed on. He dropped by the other two’s places from time to time. At the home of the first boy he couldn’t find anything that had to do with mountains or climbing; at that of the second boy his friend worked nonstop. The third boy said nothing, nor could he say anything. He called the two friends out for a meal, and told them about things he saw and heard up in the mountains. They listened, nodded, and that was all. He felt that the talk was done for, made a bow, left hand wrapped around right, and bade them goodbye.</p><p>He started to learn a craft for a living, too, but he still tried to squeeze climbing into his schedules. The higher he went, the fewer people he met. Mountain paths had become treacherous and even when two people met, each could only mind for themselves; to strike up conversations at narrow passes and crevices was utter deliria. Though the third boy’s flying thoughts kept to the sky, his light and slight figure abandoned those less realistic ways. Many saw his hesitating yet heavy tracks on the wider, trodden-bare trails instead.</p><p>He finally reached the pavilion at the mountaintop. He stood in the clouds watching the higher peaks in the near distance, with only hills and cliffs serving as the paths toward them. Perhaps under these crests and valleys ran the tunnels connecting the village to the outside, but who knew; he couldn’t see them anyways.</p><p>The boy leant against one of the pavilion’s pillar in a trance.</p><p>He wasn’t sure what he climbed for anymore.</p><p>First written on July 1st, 2019</p><p>Translated on July 7th, 2019</p><p>Hanwenheng (Billy) Liu</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>这是一篇寓言，也是我六年来第一篇汉语写作，没有英语原文，不是翻译，语言生硬不通之处请多多包涵。故事我不想做过多修改，也不想添加过多细节。我只希望我没有刻意或者无意中伤我写的朋友们。</p></blockquote><a id="more"></a><p>从前有一个村庄四面环山，虽然有隧道和外界相通，但隧道穿山而过，从出口出去时，围绕村庄的山已经成为地平线了，所以村庄里很少有人知道山有多高、多久能登顶、在山峰上能看到什么风景、山上有什么风景，村民甚至不知道环绕他们的是一座山还是一片山川。</p><p>村子里有三个男孩，他们从小在村里长大，但因为村庄很大，所以互不相识。三个人有一个共同爱好：登山。他们一开始只是站在各自家门口引颈眺望，欲穷其目以瞥一瞬山巅，或者站在为数不多的登山者一旁看他们做准备，有时他们也会梦想着自己登山的样子。过了几年后，他们可以跟着那些登山者一起进山了。虽然他们爬得不快，能最终到达的地方也不高，但他们每个人都乐在其中，也得到了不少经验。因为每个人跟的那一批登山者都不相同，所以他们登山的方法和经验也不一样。</p><p>三个男孩是在山里的一个凉亭里相遇的，纯属偶然。山上的凉亭是数代登山前辈搭建的，以供休息。通往亭子的路有很多条，亭子也有许多座，但不同的亭子需要不同水平的登山者才能到达。登山者虽然不多，但亭子里总会有其他登山者。久而久之，登山的人们会常常在亭子里吃饭、交流，更有的人把亭子作为约定地点，相约而行。</p><p>那一天是清明，踏青的好日子。许多村民都在山脚下村外围的草原上野餐。他们按耐不住登山的念头，于是在不同的地点向家人道别，背着水和零食上了山，各自来到一条对于初学者相对艰险的山路上的凉亭里。这里坐了许多和他们相似的登山初学者，他们一起欣赏风景、分享零食饮料，欢声笑语。不知道谁忽然问到所有人各自登山的目的。有人说自己登山是因为家里的长辈：他们或因身体或因家境或因生活导致自己年轻时不能登山，所以把登山希望寄托在自己身上；有人说登山有出息，走隧道坐着驴、马、车闭眼就到了，什么也看不到，登山出去是凭自己实力；有人说登山能有机会遇见珍奇草药、动物、矿石，还能给风景拍照作画，这些都赚钱。三个男孩当中有一个说自己纯粹想爬山。在山脚的生活太枯燥压抑，上了山就是解脱，而且爬到山顶能得到所有人的认可。更何况自己有登山的天赋，平时登山并不妨碍帮助家里干活，何乐而不为。</p><p>另两个男孩感觉他和自己想的差不多。在其他人走散以后，他们找到彼此继续聊了好久。</p><p>从此三个人一起结伴上山。有时他们在爬山的过程中会聊登山对自己的意义，聊村子里和家里的事，聊某个凉亭和他们常去的凉亭的差距，或者吐槽他们的凉亭或者别的凉亭里的某个大神或者菜鸟。更多的时候他们只是一前一后或者并排走着，不说话，在困难的路段时不时互相拉一把。有的时候在凉亭里他们也讨论对方或者其他人的登山方式。</p><p>虽然三个人男孩对于登山的意义的理解相似，但登山给他们带来的喜悦各不相同。一个男孩感觉登山相当于散心，他喜欢站在山坡或者峭壁眺望脚底的村庄和远处的山峦激起的澎湃思绪。如果他恰好在恋爱，走在山路上他会唱山歌，其他两个人听着他唱，不知道他哪里来的使不完的劲儿。另一个男孩喜欢大山带来的神秘。山泉从哪里来、山洞通向哪里去、山林里有什么，这些让他充满好奇，他要追查到底，让村里的人和其他登山者对他刮目相看，啧啧称赞。有时一行人会因为他的好奇心改变前行的方向，走向没人知道终点的路，尽管并不是每一次都有收获。最后一个男孩的想法永远天马行空。在村子里，他感觉生活枯燥无味，自己空有一身活力却无处释放，日常劳务烦复又繁琐，时刻压榨着他的注意力。在山里他只要站得稳、走得快，不久自己在村子里的烦恼就会被他甩在脑后，他甚至会忘掉周围的环境，尽情奔跳，享受大山带给他的幻想的时间。他的同伴对他边做白日梦边走路的习惯见怪不怪，但惊异于他从未跌倒过。</p><p>三个男孩的默契和快乐不言而喻。他们在山里度过的时间越来越长，他们能到达的高度也逐渐提升，登山技巧也日益见长，他们的装备也从一开始自制品变为村子卖的入门装备，最后变为外面进来的业余爱好装备。</p><p>有一天，两个男孩发现另一个男孩上山的频率开始降低了，直到他们再也没在山上见到过他。每次在村庄里遇见他时，他们会谈起在山上的经历和快乐，并问他什么时候再一同上山。他的回答总是“改天再上去”。几年过去了，有个男孩终于忍不住问他为什么不再上山，他说，“我再也没有心情上去了。”他没有说的是，在爬到了一定高度的最后一天，他回家后做的第一件事就是把自己的登山装备扔进火炉里，然后把火炉砸成铁皮，和灰烬一同扔到了在路口等着去山外垃圾场的车上。除了他家人，没人知道。</p><p>另两个男孩依旧相约登山，甚至到达了山上比他们常去的那个凉亭更高、在更艰险的路途上的凉亭。有一天，他们即将到达下一个凉亭，但因为时间原因必须折返，他们约定第二天再次挑战。其中一个男孩回到家，心里想到的是到达下一个凉亭时的满足和收到的赞扬，眼睛里看到的时父母严肃的脸。他们让他停止登山，说：“家里的活太多，需要你帮忙，而且你也到了一心一意学习一门维持生计的手艺了，只登山是吃不饱饭的。登山的人那么多，怎么就能轮到你？”在他苦苦地央求下他争取到最后一次登山的机会：他要到达下一个凉亭。他在家里研究攀爬技巧，计算时间，一遍遍地观看前人的登山经验。另一个男孩在这段时间里自己一遍遍向那个凉亭发起挑战，尽管每次都一点点靠近，但每天还是无果而归。直到一天，男孩儿终于准备好了，他和他的朋友最后一次相约而行。这一次，他们在山上看遍了自已想看但一直没来得及看的地方，逛遍了每一处山林，摸透了每一条河流的走向，走到了每一个山洞的尽头。在太阳落山前，两个人爬到了迄今为止他们见过的最大的凉亭。亭子里的登山者们击掌相迎，请他们一同进餐、过夜，一群人彻夜长聊。第二天，男孩下山完成自己对父母的保证，学了能养家的手艺。独立后的他也想再次成为登山者，他的装备尚未过时，他的经验也没有粗糙，只是养家是意外的忙碌。他终于没有时间也没有心情登山了。</p><p>另一个男孩毫不知情，独自继续前行。他不时到另两位男孩家里做客。他看到一个人家里没有任何和登山有关的物品、注意到新炉子，他发现另一个人无时无刻不在处理生意，他没说什么，也说不了什么。他和他们聊自己在山上的见闻和成就。他们听着，问着，评论着，仅此而已。他觉得这天再也聊不下去了，转身告辞。</p><p>他也终于开始学习一门养家的手艺，但他依旧见缝插针，争取上山的机会。他再也没有看到过当初第一个亭子里那样多的人，他爬得越高，遇见的人越少。山路险峻，众人即便相逢也只自求多福，狭路相逢更是从何谈笑？</p><p>有一天他到达了围绕村子的山顶的亭子里。他站在云里看到不远处更高的山峰，唯一到达的路只有陡峭的下行山坡和上行岩壁。也许在重峦叠嶂之外就是村子的隧道出口，可是谁知道呢，反正他也看不到。</p><p>男孩倚在凉亭的柱子上发呆。</p><p>他已经不清楚自己为了什么而登山了。</p><p>2019年7月1日</p><p>柳</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>“We certainly weren’t <em>this</em> loud when we were freshmen.” Lily glances around the cafeteria. Wading through the chattering crowd with an empty stomach, only to find a rather cramped table for four in a corner is <em>not</em> her ideal first day of senior year in middle school. Her friends nod in agreement. “I wish it’s still summer.”</p><p>“Definitely not ready for school, no.” Julia pulls an extra chair over.</p><p>“No kidding.” Landon comes over with a slice of cheese cake, four cupcakes, and two big chunks of brownie. He hands one brownie to Max and tries to stuff the other into Julia’s mouth, and gives the cupcake plate to Lily and Mae. “I guess especially you, Mae, since you missed most of it in the Treasure Trove.”</p><a id="more"></a><p>Mae thanks him and nods. The Treasure Trove is the bookstore not far from Mae’s house, where her mother, Catherine Murray, works. Over the summer Mae worked there part time as well. It’s one of the few things she managed to persuade her mother.</p><p>“I heard Mr. Mackenzie likes having you there.” Max says. Mr. Mackenzie is the balding owner of the Treasure Trove. “He doesn’t say it in front of Cate, but he tells us you’re the shop’s mascot.”</p><p>“Duh. Mae’s smile can melt snow. I’d have her as a mascot, too, if I were him.” Julia rolls her eyes.</p><p>Landon asks through a mouthful of casserole,</p><p>“Why are you working there again?”</p><p>“Make some money. Help out mom after… you know…” Mae’s face gets redder by the second, “…dad got in jail after a bar fight back in April.”</p><p>“Oh right. Sorry.” Landon jerks as Julia kicks him under the table.</p><p>“No, it’s fine. It’s quiet with him gone. Working around books is nice, too. See, I’ve been thinking,” Mae taps her small chin with the handle of her fork, “I shall buy mom something… a present – with my first pay.”</p><p>“Good idea.” Max agrees.</p><p>Around them the clamor reaches its apex as students from all three grade years dig in. Freshmen argue loudly over contents from their morning classes, bragging about the little they know of the material on the last few pages of their textbooks: Plato and the Cave, Einstein and the wave-particle theory, genes and TALENs, etc. The Sophomores snigger behind their backs, throwing fugitive glances at the little know-it-alls. The seniors like Mae and her friends are too tired already to care a thing about what’s going on around them. “Why are they treating us like high school students?” They groan. “It’s not like I want to enroll in the high school department <em>here</em>.”</p><p>“…hmm… Dad’s out in November… I think I should get him something as well…” Mae absentmindedly sucks on the tips of her fork.</p><p>“What?” All four of her friends round on her.</p><p>“Just - nothing.” Mae bends down to her salad.</p><p>“So soon?” Landon and Julia ask in unison.</p><p>“What are you getting him?” Max asks.</p><p>“Hold on a moment,” Lily frowns. “Why?”</p><p>“Why not?” Mae mumbles.</p><p>Mae’s father, Richard Murray, is the town of Alvar’s infamous alcoholic. Large and menacing, he fell down the water hole ever since his first factory went bankrupt ten years ago. His fall from a respectable factory manager to a despicable peasant at another factory (in his own words) was just a little too hard, it seems. It takes the stars to align for the small town of Alvar to see him sober for a month straight. His alcohol-fueled rages have even earned him a ban from the local tavern: the story goes that Bart the Bartender had to threaten him out at musket-point. He ended up seeking booze in Bennon, the nearest city, and as of April, the last bar he visited banned him, too, after he wreaked havoc inside over an argument. He went to jail. The bar went under renovation. Neither is over, yet.</p><p>Even without alcohol he has an ugly reputation. It’s no secret about the domestic violence in the Murray household. The neighbors are all too familiar with the cries of Catherine and Mae, as well as the sound of materials breaking: porcelain, glass, wood, metal, and even bricks in the wall. Mae used to have bruises and wounds on her arms and legs that she’d brush off with a lie, and nowadays she covers them up under sleeves and long pants or dress. Catherine is said to have shown up once in the clinic with a broken wrist and a swollen eye. The doctors aren’t fooled by her “took a fall” talk, but they can’t do anything except tending the wounds. Cate’s left eye never healed to what it was before.</p><p>No one in town can do anything about it: no one can get concrete evidence of his abuse. Sure, maybe Mae is underage and susceptible to threats and fear and keeps her silence, but Catherine Murray – is it religious fervor or simply Stockholm Syndrome? – never admits it, either. No one understood why, when Mae’s grandfather Ryan Murray came into town three years ago with a cricket bat after been tipped off about his son and chased Richard Murray through the streets, determined to beat him into a pulp for what he did, it was Catherine who threw her arms before the broken man to plead her father-in-law to have mercy.</p><p>The best the Alvarians can do, and did, is to ensure that Richard Murray never gets his hands on a gun. The police confiscated his hunting rifle years ago, and make excuses to search him whenever they meet him in the streets.</p><p>Mae is kind, and Lily knows that better than anyone; but to endure years of abuse and still gift her abuser is inconceivable to her. She opens her mouth and can’t find the words to shut it.</p><p>“He… isn’t really a good dad, is he?” Julia doesn’t like the idea of being nice to Richard Murray, either. She tries to relieve the awkwardness.</p><p>“He never gave <em>you</em> any presents, right?” Compared to offending Mae, Landon right now is more worried about Lily blowing up into one of her own frenzies. He has only seen it once: she was as silent before the outburst then as she is now, and that once was enough for a lifetime.</p><p>“We just want your first income go to people who really deserve it.” Max is earnest as always.</p><p>“I –” Lily starts, and immediately the other three tries to stop her,</p><p>“Lily!”</p><p>“– want to hear what you think, that’s all.” She finishes.</p><p>“He’s my dad. I won’t be alive has it not been for him.” Mae mumbles again.</p><p>Landon, Julia, and Max look from Mae to Lily to Mae and to each other, all thinking that one day Mae might <em>just</em> be alive has it not been for her father. They wait for Lily’s response, anxious. All she says softly is,</p><p>“I’m sorry.”</p><center>**</center><p>It’s the Saturday before Richard Murray’s release. Mae’s grandparents accompany her to the Bennon Mall. It’s only the first day of November, and the banners hanging from the metal frames of the huge arching skylight overhead are already prophesying the discounts and deals to come. Shoppers are everywhere. Children drag their parents into toy shops and candy stores that dot the length of the hall. Young couples and teenagers dance in and out of fashion stores. Families of two or three or more crowd the walkway or aggregate around benches. Even the bookstore looks smaller from the outside with all the people. <em>Everyone wants to start early with the Thanksgiving shopping.</em> Mae says to herself and can hardly hear her own voice in her head, so she says it over and over again.</p><p>This is her first time in the mall without the Liu’s. However much Lily’s parents insist that she is as good as part of the family, Mae can never fully push through the invisible wall in her mind. She feels herself ungrateful and cruel. It’s strange today, walking through the crowd, not with them and conflicting with herself but having her own burly Grandfather Ryan in the front making the way and her own plump Grandmother Diane beside her offering an arm. Under the canopy of banners blaring “THANKSGIVING WARM-UP SALE” and “5% OFF IN /C<strong><strong>* /K</strong></strong>“, Mae thinks that perhaps this is what shopping with her own mother might be in another world. If she was the type she might even pine at her mother or grandmother for some pretty coat or a pair of shoes in the display window. Bottom line: Mae doesn’t have to avoid looking at other families in the mall anymore.</p><p>“Great Scott, what a blasphemy. Where’s the Christmas songs already!” Grandma Diane says in Mae’s ear. “Remember, back in ‘94, you listen to Christmas songs on November 1st.”</p><p>“Oh shucks, old girl,” Grandpa Ryan turns around and walks backwards, “‘94! <em>‘94</em> - on our first date in <em>‘64</em> they played Carla Thomas before Halloween –”</p><p>“Don’t listen to him, dear.” Grandma Diane tugs Mae close and says in a carrying whisper, “We were <em>not</em> dating when we were six.”</p><p>“Psh! Come over to gramps, Mae, and tell us, anyone you fancy back in Alvar –”</p><p>“Be a gent and go on make way for the ladies, you!” Grandma Diane waves her hand.</p><p>Embarrassed, Mae blushes. She is always scared of conflicts, and shies away even from minor disagreements. But she doesn’t mind the old couple bickering somehow. It isn’t like her father yelling drunkenly at her mother, rather, more like Landon and Julia - it’s cute. Perhaps this is what her friends will be like in 50 years. <em>And hopefully not with a granddaughter abused by their son.</em> She thinks.</p><p>The cloud passes by the sun in the azure sky outside, and they come to a fashion store.</p><p>“Really?” Mae peers questioningly into the interior. In the brightly-lit space, a sea of shelves and racks bearing clothes in the style of, deeper and deeper in, casual, business-casual, business, sports, and undergarments.</p><p>“Of course. We buy our own clothes here.” Grandpa Ryan says.</p><p>“Old soot has quite an eye for fashion still.” Grandma Diane pats Mae’s arm.</p><p>Mae has to agree. The store is packed with mostly young people too hip for her to look at. They are joyous and loud, moving their limbs in exaggerated ways – the sort of people that one might see in fashion commercials. So <em>this</em> is where they get to look the part.</p><p>“We’ll get Charlie’s with Ryan’s. They wear the same size – you, my dear, we ought to get you something, too.” Grandma Diane nods.</p><p>“What - no, you don’t have to –”</p><p>“It’s our call here, dear.”</p><p>“But I don’t know how –”</p><p>“Pick whatever you fancy. Your mother has some weird ideas about ‘daily attires’, as she says. Not that she doesn’t about other things –” Grandpa Ryan says.</p><p>“Ryan!” Grandma snaps.</p><p>“Anyways, pick something that’s not gray or ‘austere’. Off you go. We’ll be over there.”</p><p><em>Grandpa doesn’t like mom much, huh.</em> Mae thinks as she browses the racks and models. <em>How did mom even get married to dad?</em> She realizes that she knows almost nothing about her parents: what they were like as children, how they met, and how her father came to be who he is today. Maybe he used to be one of the rowdy teens in the crowd behind her, cracking jokes with his friends and girlfriend; or maybe he was like Max, quiet and honest and caring until some incident flipped him around –</p><p><em>Oh no, impossible. Max is nothing like him.</em> Mae frowns at the clothes. Almost every one of them looks too fashionable, and Mae has trouble imagining herself in them. Julia would fit right in for all of them, and Lily might be slightly pickier about what she puts on, but her? Eh. Poncho coats? Retro denim jacket? Leather bomber jacket? Suede coat complete with matching cashmere scarf and hat?</p><p>“Can I help you?” A store assistant bounces over. Mae’s face goes red at her bust.</p><p>“Oh, um –” Maybe she should just refuse. “I’m wondering if you have –” What should she get? “ – any coats –” Yes, a coat is suitable. <em>Pfft, “suit”-able. A coat suits.</em> She grins, embarrassed. “ – that are more – “ Mae swallows the words, “for me”. “ – I mean, <em>less</em>, um… bright?” <em>Phew.</em></p><p>“Less bright? I think a bright color would match your hair great! No? Well, if you insist…” The girl picks out a few coats with darker shades. Mae looks around for her grandparents. They catch her eyes and wink. <em>Okay then.</em> She sighs.</p><center>**</center><p>The best type of clothes her mother likes is the type with no decorations at all: she herself wears plain white blouse and gray dresses. The only difference between different seasons is the length of the sleeves and the thickness of the fabric. If she was at home she might also change to loose sweatpants. The most decorative clothes she (and Mae) owns are blouses with lace at seams and collar, looking like straight out of an 1800s painting. The burgundy long coat with a shoulder cape as collars that Mae chose should stand well with her: the most decorative pieces on there are the double columns of brass buttons. Mae likes its vintage-yet-updated design and the color. When she tried it on, it was a slim-fit yet not hindering her movements. The shop assistant said she had an eye for it, and Mae decided to give her the benefit of doubt. <em>It’s warm, anyways. Mom won’t talk.</em></p><p>As for her father… What will he be wearing when he comes back on Thursday? Will her clothes fit?</p><p>“Are the seats taken?” The mischievous voice is one that Mae knows well. She whisks her head up from her food and sure enough, finds herself beaming at Lily’s father. Beside him are Lily’s smiling mother and the grinning Lily herself.</p><p>“Not for you.” Grandpa Ryan laughs and pats the seats. “Sit down already!”</p><p>“I didn’t think we’d meet you here!” Lily hugs Mae as Lily’s mother and Grandma Diane greet each other warmly. “Shopping, too? Wait, is it about the presents you talked about two months ago? What did you get?” Mae shows her.</p><p>“Sweater and thick pants for Richard. Hmm, they ought to keep him warm.” Lily’s father says.</p><p>“Picked them out herself.” Grandpa Ryan puffs out his chest.</p><p>“A bookbinding kit for Catherine?” Lily’s mother leans over.</p><p>“Picked it out herself.” Grandpa Ryan puffs out his chest again.</p><p>“I was surprised how much she knew about those crafting kits.” Grandma Diane says.</p><p>“Mom taught me.” Mae says simply.</p><p>“Anything for yourself?” Lily asks.</p><p>“Well… there’s the coat, but gramps and gran paid for it –”</p><p>“Picked it out herself!” Grandpa Ryan puffs out his chest for the third time.</p><p>“Say something else, idiot!” Grandma Diane slaps his shoulder. “You still have some money left, don’t you, dear? Go get yourself something.”</p><p><em>Buy myself something with my own money… That’s sounds so alien.</em> She thinks. It must be the possessive, <em>her own</em> money. She can’t deny it’s a good idea, though: the final cherry on the top for that feeling of accomplishment. Besides, everything she bought so far weren’t too expensive. There <em>is</em> plenty money to spare.</p><p>She already has a new coat, though. What else should she get?</p><p>“Yeah… maybe a teddy bear for a change…”</p><p>“Or you can get your first phone with me.” Lily suggests.</p><p><em>A phone, huh.</em></p><p>“If you do, we can switch to a family plan together.” Says Grandpa Ryan. “Like, <em>finally</em>. You know how much our current plan costs, Diane?”</p><p>“We should make you two her emergency contact if Mae goes for the phone. We might be too late when we get to her all the way from Bennon.” Grandma Diane says.</p><p>“Certainly.” Lily’s mother nods.</p><p><em>A phone, huh.</em> Mae considers this. Her own phone… it’d be much easier to call her grandparents if she gets one, and to contact Lily and her parents as well, if issues (<em>Dad,</em> she corrects herself) arise. Max has a phone, too… she can get his number. She smiles and nods. What’s to worry about – it’s <em>her</em> money. Besides, they’re a quarter way in to the 21st century, and she’ll be 14 next month. It’s time she joins the modern world and starts to leave her mother’s old one.</p><p><em>Exciting.</em>  </p><center>**</center><p>The door is ripped open and slammed shut on Thursday evening, and Mae jumps so hard that she almost drops the plate she’s washing. Trying her best to suppress the trembling of her legs, she turns halfway around to watch the hallway outside the kitchen. <em>There goes peace and quiet.</em> She sighs. <em>How should I give him the clothes?</em> Part of her says that she doesn’t want to, and that her friends were right to object in the first place.</p><p>There’s a “thud” as her father kicks off a boot, and is followed by huffing and low growling. <em>If it’s an effort to kick off one boot, then he’s too drunk already.</em> Indeed it doesn’t take ten seconds for the sour stench of alcohol to waft past Mae. What did she expect, really? That her father would repent in jail? That the jail would make him a new man? That her life would become a better one? Of course he would come home and leave for booze hunt right after finding his car key, if she has to guess. After another loud thud, Richard Murray stomped his way down the hall. Mae braces herself.</p><p>Little by little Richard Murray emerges from behind the kitchen door frame out of the dim hallway. First is his flat and straight forehead plastered with his furiously red hair roughed by wind and sweat and melted snow. Then comes the heavy and uncouth face, screwed up as he concentrated on putting one foot before the other. So what if they shaved him before his release? Whiskey and vodka put them right back onto his wide chin and square jaws in one mere hour. There’s a new bleeding scar next to his huge nose standing out against his old ones. Who shattered under his fists tonight?</p><p>“Welcome home, dad.”</p><p>His head swivels on his thick neck between his slouching shoulder and in he staggers. <em>Oh no, oh no.</em> Mae holds the plate and the sponge close. Richard Murray throws out an arm and shovels her aside. Mae hits the fridge and slides into the corner between it and the wall, ignorant of the soap water she squeezed out of the sponge in reflex. The reek off of her father is making her sick.</p><p>“Damn place ain’t got a mirror now?” He growls.</p><p><em>This isn’t the bathroom. Go away. Go away.</em> Mae thinks. <em>Go away already!</em></p><p>“Fucking snow. Ice everywhere. Slips. Damn fuck.” He rubs his scar looking at his reflection in the window pane. “WHY AIN’T THIS SHIT WORKING!” He strikes the window. It cracks into a spiderweb.</p><p><em>Go away. Go away. Thank god mom had it changed to laminated glass since last time. Go away already…</em></p><p>Mae’s prayer might as well as works. Her father stumbles around and out of the kitchen without looking at her. <em>Thank god all I got was a shove.</em> She goes shakily back to the sink and opens the other, uncracked window. The night air rushes in and Mae shivers. Between the cold and her father’s reek, she’d rather freeze.</p><p>“CATHERINE!” goes Richard Murray on the second floor. His footsteps moves closer and closer overhead. “Won’t even come out and greet me after six months? The Lius grew you guts, eh?”</p><p>“No, I’m sor –”. There’s a slap from directly overhead and her mother breaks off. Mae freezes.</p><p>“I’ll get them tomorrow! ALL of them!” Her father howls. “From that wimp to his wife to his cheeky little girl –” He rants and slurs and Mae considers shutting the window. This is no longer a choice between the stench and cold air, now.</p><p><em>Maybe having the neighbors hear him would help us.</em> She slides it close. <em>But then there’s mom.</em></p><p>“– for six months I had nothing!” and there’s a violent “thump”. Mae hears her mother squeal and the bed springs groan. She knows too well what’s happening upstairs. She feels sick. The running water helps little blocking the sounds, and very soon she finds herself locking her bedroom door, glad it’s on the first floor at the opposite end of the house.</p><p>On a chair next to her desk is the bundle of sweater and pants she wrapped the evening before. Perhaps she should just throw them away, or give them to her grandfather: someone, like Max said, who deserves it. </p><p>In the distance come her mother’s faint moan. Mae flips open the book she borrowed and tries to read. Keats usually pulls her in instantly, but not today: two layers of doors and a layer of floor can’t stop her ears from picking up the faintest of those sounds that she almost grew up with. Her mother never resists, always trying her best to live up to the “good wife” model she worships. “It’s our duty to make our husbands happy.” She said. But does she really believe in it? Lily’s mother never says that, and Lily’s father doesn’t drink like a fish, either. They are both happy. <em>But do they also–?</em> Mae screws her eyes shut, ashamed of the thought. <em>No, stop it. What am I thinking?</em> Then she can’t help but adds, <em>Where else would Lily come from… But even if they do, it’s not like dad with mom.</em> She can now hear her father cursing at her mother. It’s emanating from the wall itself. Mae pushes <em>Keats</em> away and runs to the bathroom to wash. When she finally dries herself and curls up in bed, she still feels dirty.</p><p>Should she call someone? It’s still not too late. Her grandparents, at least, are awake. Or perhaps Lily, or even Max. What should she say? </p><p><em>I’m scared.</em></p><p>Of what?</p><p><em>My dad.</em></p><p>Why? </p><p><em>…</em></p><p>Julia is a better person to talk to, but she doesn’t have a phone, nor Landon, who lives next to her.</p><p><em>I really needn’t buy that, huh. Nothing can improve my life one bit.</em> Mae covers her ears with her pillow. <em>Should’ve gone with the teddy bear.</em></p><center>**</center><p>The train pulls into Alvar Station at 5 o’clock the next day. The clouds in the grey sky look almost touching the tree tops. To the south, outside the station, the layers of roofs along the Alvar Hill are capped in snow. Mae busies herself with redoing her bun in front of a window, pulling it apart and rewrapping it, her teeth clenched tight. Landon’s face appears behind hers in the reflection.</p><p>“You’ll be pulling your hair out.”</p><p>“Don’t want to take chances.” Mae’s scalp screams at the pull but she doesn’t care. Her mother found her left the dishes from last night half-done this morning and wasn’t happy. With her father now home, she’d better make sure nothing ticks either of them off.</p><p>Julia catches up and winces at the last snap of the elastic band. She loosens her own ponytail in reflex.</p><p>“I know your mom is strict with your hair, but isn’t that too much? You’ve already redone it before we left.” She says. Mae looks at her own feet out of habit and shakes her head. “Oh right… your dad’s back.”</p><p>Mae nods and turns to leave the station.</p><p>“So… how was it last night? Did you give your dad his present?” Landon asks.</p><p>“Don’t want to talk about last night.” Mae mutters to the ground. Landon frowns, troubled. Julia wraps an arm around her.</p><p>“Talking might help you feel better. It worked before.”</p><p>Mae looks up into Julia’s clear, blue eyes with her green ones. Last night she wanted to do anything to tell Julia what was happening, and now she can’t bring herself to it. Perhaps it has to do with Landon be present. Perhaps it has to do with her realization that nobody can help her. Her bun feels heavy and she hangs her head again. Julia stops. She turns Mae around.</p><p>“Was it that bad?” She asks, worried. Mae nods. “Then come home with me for the night - I’ll convince my parents; or go to Lily’s place when they come back, if you want to.”</p><p>“Yeah, I think that’s a good idea, you stay with Julia or Lily.” Landon echoes. “Like, out of sight, out of mind. Or you can come with me. I don’t might sleeping on the couch.”</p><p>“I can’t always run away.” Mae says in a small voice. “And I can’t go anywhere unless dad’s away in the city.”</p><p>Julia makes a face. Lily would drag Mae home without a second thought. Her family accommodates Mae and her mother often whenever Richard Murray goes out for drinks at night – ever since her father was banned from Shamrock and Eagle – to help them avoid him when he come home drunk, so it’s much easier for them to stay there. Max, always considerate, would be a big help right now, too: Mae likes Max. She’d consider his words, at least. It’s unfortunate that they are coming home with their parents at the university today, and Julia would rather not manhandle her friend and force her home with her. It irritates her that she can’t do anything to help, and she doesn’t like how downcast Mae look. She sighs and gathers Mae into her arms, muttering, “Oh you, poor little bird, you…”</p><p>“I’ll be fine.” </p><p>Julia raises her eyebrows and pushes the corners of Mae’s mouth up with her fingers. She has never seen such helpless and dim eyes above smiling lips. Those big eyes blink and Mae breaks into a smile on her own. She shakes herself lose from Julia.</p><p>“Well, that works. A bit.” Landon says from aside.</p><p>“Thanks. I shall be going now.” Mae waves and turns.</p><p>“Call us if you need us, okay?” Julia shouts after her. “Any of us! Or our parents! Keep your phone with you, okay?”</p><p>Mae nods to the ground and heads uphill in quick steps. She probably ticked Julia off with her little rebellion, since she usually follows along her advice, sometimes pretending to follow to not make her feel bad. Not this time: words alone can’t change the reality, and neither can her mother nor her. <em>Why didn’t he just die in a fight or something.</em> Mae is startled by her own thought. <em>No, no… don’t think like that…</em></p><p>She turns onto Shamrock Road and one block later the road opens up to the Main Street. Down to her left, blocks away, are the train tracks crossing over the road that curves out of sight and connects eventually to the highway to Bennon. Up on her right is the rest of the town, layers and layers of tiered, flat rooftops, their red or black tiles poking out of the fresh snow caps from last night, paving higher and higher uphill until it meets the dark-green forest. At the hilltop, Mae can make out the white-capped dome of the Alvar Observatory. Dots of light blink on throughout the hillside, from streetlamps and windows. It’s always a sight for Mae: it’s as though the stars themselves have descended upon the town in the falling darkness, transforming it into the Fairyland. It looks cozy in the frigid air. Mae is convinced that it’s the snow-laden Alvar in the evenings that’s on so many Christmas cards out there.</p><p><em>Had there only a clear sky.</em></p><p>Everything - the houses, the cars, the people, this very town - is ready for the night. The heavy sky presses the wintry wind down and grinds it on Alvar like a useless sponge scrubbing the snow. “Forlorn”, that’s the word that comes into Mae’s mind as she surveys the view through a natural gray filter.</p><p>A school bus roars down Main Street, and Mae wonders briefly what it feels like to come home on that, instead of the train – what does it feel like to have a normal “home” to come back to at all? Would it be that far from packing up to go to Lily’s house for the night with her mother? She’s happy when she’s with them, happy and safe, knowing that they won’t be woken up by her father’s drunken noises or be used as his rage-vent, even though she can’t look past the fact that she’s not part of Lily’s family – she doesn’t look like them, after all; she’s nothing like them – or that she’s still more reserved around her mother and can’t act naturally, to be “herself”.</p><p><em>Home, huh. What does it even mean?</em> Mae crosses Main Street. She picks her way through unshoveled snow and thick sheets of ice. <em>A familiar place with familiar people? A safe and happy place to return to or, even, to hide in?</em> She nods her greeting to the plump wife of Bart the Bartender, who’s walking her granddaughter home from grocery shopping. <em>Was that what Ruth was sick for, as Keats wrote, standing in the cornfield?</em> Those plants can grow up to six feet or even more, way taller than what Ruth could be, and they’re yet to be seen on the coast of the Mediterranean in her era. Standing in the dark maze of alien plant, sick for a familiar, safe haven – <em>Keats’ brilliant.</em> – yes, that suffocation and hopelessness, Mae knows too well.</p><center>**</center><p>Her phone vibrates when Mae is almost home. It’s from Max.</p><p><em>Didn’t get to ask today - is everything alright at home, with your dad back and everything?</em></p><p>It brings a small smile on her face. She should’ve gotten <em>him</em> something instead.</p><p><em>It’ll be fine. I’m</em></p><p>She hesitates before continuing,</p><p><em>home. Chat later.</em></p><p>Her mother’s portrait of the Virgin greets her as usual. Whoever drew it must’ve tried to make her blind: her eyes are those of the dead, looking past her long nose above the small puckered mouth without a purpose or a focus. What’s <em>she</em> so sad about, anyways - giving birth to the God’s son must’ve been all women’s dream in her time. Mae avoids her gaze and hangs up her coat.</p><p>Catherine is in the kitchen preparing dinner, in her gray cotton dress and looking more dour than usual.</p><p>“Mom, I’m back.”</p><p>“You’re a bit late.” Her mother doesn’t sound angry.</p><p>“I’m sorry.” Mae knows better.</p><p>“Wash your hands and come help.”</p><p>“Yes, mom.”</p><p>Does her mother really love her? Her mother did look up when she called out. On rare occasions in which Mae cuts herself while chopping, Catherine would always treat her immediately, and not without tenderness. When she was little Mae even considered injuring herself on purpose just to experience that care. <em>Is it really out of love, or is it her ‘being a good wife’ nonsense?</em></p><p>In the living room, her father sits spreadeagled on the couch watching TV with a scowl. Mae stands at the entrance way, about to take off her shoes and greet him before she registers what he’s wearing.</p><p>The new sweater and the pants fit him well.</p><p>He turns his head and their eyes meet, bloodshot green on clear green. One thing Mae has learned in her life is that she should never get her hopes up, but for one split second, as she half-bowed to untie her shoelaces, she is deluded with a vision of her father giving her a gruff “thanks”. She almost smiles before she realizes that the clothes should be in a package in her room, and her mother never knew about it being wrapped or placed thus. What was he searching her room for?</p><p>“So.” Richard Murray growls. Mae straightened up. “So.”</p><p>“Hi dad, I’m back.” Mae says automatically.</p><p>“Grew wings, eh?” Richard Murray sneers. “Making money like a big girl now, eh?” He stands up and advances, eyes narrowed. Mae trembles. “I get in for six months and already you’re making a life without me, eh, setting up your own little bank and everything?” Mae has to clench her teeth to stop them from clattering. In the kitchen, the sound of her mother’s chopping stops.  She takes a step back. “Where’s the rest of your money?” He demands. “Hand them over!” He’s drunk. The stink is faint but he’s definitely drunk. “NOW!” Mae backs off and her father presses on. “<em>DIDN’T YOU HEAR ME?</em>“</p><p>The kitchen light is thrown upon his menacing and scarred face, and Lily’s face blooms into Mae’s mind. Richard Murray lurches for her. Crash goes her bag onto the floor as she turns to run, slipping through his fingers and out of the front door.</p><p>The chilly air seeps into her clothes. She should’ve grabbed her coat. The darkness is falling fast and it’s becoming difficult to see the ice patches. Mae dares not run too slow; she does her best keeping to the snow and away from the more slippery ice. When her father is out of the door she is already at the block junction of 2nd Street and Shamrock Road. Did her mother try to stop him, or was he too drunk to turn the handle? If he was, then he might slip on the ice – It almost feels as though the sidewalk is pulled from under her. She falls and bangs her knee on the metal fence around the neighboring house. Mae scrambles to get up and the very next second she feels the steel toes of her father’s hunting boots connect with her thigh. The kick sends her sliding across the junction.</p><p>She is picked up by her hair the next moment and receives a sound slap, then another, and a third. They reverberated in the air and leave her ears ringing. There’s nothing she can see other than her father’s heavy face. She tries to stand: her scalp feels like tearing off her skull.</p><p>“<em>This’ll</em> teach you!” Richard Murray snarls. “<em>This</em> is for your damned bank! <em>This</em> for your bitchy clothes. <em>This</em> –”</p><p>“No, dad - stop! Please!” Mae sobs, reaching up to release her hair.</p><p>“<em>Give me the money!</em>“ Richard Murray screams and punches her. Mae feels like the impact ripped a muscle in her neck. She flies out of her father’s hand, collides with the cobblestone wall beside them, and lands head-first onto the sidewalk. A car skids to a halt and a man gets off, yelling,</p><p>“What’s going on here? Stop what you’re doing!”</p><p>“Help! Help me, please – ah!” Mae watches her father punch the man in the face, who bounces off his own car and slides down.</p><p>Mae has to get up and get away. Blood trickles down her face and pain flares across her forehead, her thigh, and her knee. She manages to raise. Richard Murray makes to follow, then turns to kick the man from the car off of his leg. He spots his daughter staggering across the road and strides over.</p><p>“Someone stops Richard Murray! Anyone!” The man struggles to get up and yells. Richard Murray gives a low growl and doubles back to him.</p><p>There’s a brief struggle. It ends with Richard Murray kicking the man in the face, knocking him out.</p><p>Mae loses her footing when she’s a few steps from the sidewalk. She collapses, shivering with cold and pain. Something must’ve happened to her brain when she banged her head on the ground: the world is in a vertigo and she can’t tell which way she was going towards. She crawls forward anyways: to move is to increase the odds of survival – her father lifts her up by her sweater and slams her down like a doll.</p><p>“Why do you hate me so much?” She blurts out.</p><p>“I’ll show you why!” Her father lands another kick on her back. She shrieks in pain and collapses.</p><p><em>That’s it.</em> She’s freezing. She’s broken. To get up requires a herculean effort she doesn’t possess. <em>That’s all there is for me.</em> Mae curls up in the middle of the road, grits her teeth, and waits to die.</p><p>How does it come to this, she can’t remember anymore. As her father kicks, slaps, punches, and throws her, she wonders incoherently whether she really is his daughter. Has it always been like this? Had there been happier times that she forgot? Her only memories of her father are ones of terror. Among these pieces of thoughts she cries for her mother, but who is it that she’s really yearning for? Definitely not Catherine Murray.</p><p>Her father’s roars stopped being intelligible long ago. How come nobody is coming out of their homes to help? Only the mister from the car tried and failed rather miserably. <em>Of course… a car isn’t a home. Home’s safe, and no idiot’s forsaking that for me. Me. Heh. Me. Understand Ruth sick for home. What a joke. Don’t have one.</em></p><p>She can’t feel her body anymore. She can’t feel her father’s blows, either. How many bones are broken in her body now? How many organs have ruptured from impact? How many breaths does she have left? <em>Snuff me out already.</em> She holds onto this only thought as she lies there, her red hair spreading around her under the streetlight like blood.</p><p><em>Mom didn’t even try to stop him. She never did.</em></p><p>Deep inside her, a memory breaks loose – more like a dream: a warm one, echoing with lullaby and filled with a sweet and comforting scent; a pair of loving hands patting her to sleep.</p><p>It’s shattered by a heart-splitting scream that Mae can hardly hear anymore. The next kick doesn’t connect with her body as something – someone clasps themselves around her, and with the sharp pain that follows she fades with that memory.</p><center>**</center><p>Max combs the wig smooth. It falls past Mae’s shoulder just to the spot her real hair does when loose. He hands the comb back to Julia and holds up a mirror.</p><p>“There. How is it?”</p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p>Max sees her crack expression, and smiles himself, too. It’s a small lift of the corners of her lips, her first since she woke up, as though she’s hiding it. Just like he remembers. Landon leans against the wall, arms crossed, and says,</p><p>“Nice.”</p><p>Julia swipes a stray strand behind Mae’s ear, saying,</p><p>“They’ll grow out before long.”</p><p>The doctors at the Bennon City Hospital had to shave Mae to stitch the wounds on her head. It was a rather nasty surprise for both her friends and her when they first visited her after she woke up two weeks ago. How did she make it through? Mae has gathered that she didn’t look good at all when they sent her in. Multiple fractured bones and internal bleeding. They had to literally patch her up in a series of surgeries, and even now, most of her body is thick with bandage, as was with her head. She’s tied down by wires and tubes to monitors by her bed; her right arm is in plaster, and even though her left arm isn’t, she has trouble holding anything steady. As for her legs, there is another surgery scheduled for tomorrow, and many more to come after that for other parts of her body.  She can’t do anything, not even cleaning herself. She feels ugly and gross.</p><p>“It’s some hell you’ve been through,” Landon says. “You’re tough. I’m glad you are alive, Mae.”</p><p>Mae doesn’t reply. Should <em>she</em> be glad? In the past nights, as her fractured memories resurfaced and tried to stitch themselves together, Mae relived that evening again and again in her nightmares. She has become scared of sleeping, staring out of the gap of the window curtains every night until she drifts off, only to jolt awake soon to the beeping of the cardiograph and sometimes the face of the nurse on duty. She dares not ask anyone when she’ll make a full recovery, or if she is able to at all. The future holds no light for her: in the end, she’ll always have to go back to her abysmal home. Sure, her father might be in jail again for this, but he’ll come out at some point. When he does, it’ll just start all over again, and her mother will still not stop him. <em>I haven’t seen her after I woke up, either.</em> Mae thinks. She never knew what it feels like to be angry. She just feels lonely and forsaken, even though her friends are around her bed.</p><p>The ward door slides open and her nurse comes with her lunch.</p><p>“We can take care of that.” Max receives it with both hands, face red under his black curls. “Thank you.”</p><p>“Oh no, thank <em>you</em>.” The nurse replies and says to Mae. “There are more visitors coming up right now, Mae. I think I see your mother.”</p><p>“Guess <em>I</em> better take over that. Can’t give Catherine the wrong idea.” Julia winks at Max.</p><p>Max returns a shy grin and hands over the tray.</p><p>“Say ‘ahhh’, Mae. Mm-hmm.” Landon leans over and peers at Julia cooling a spoonful of porridge down and feeding it to Mae. “Guess that means she’s finally out –”</p><p>“Eat up!” Julia coos Mae in an unnecessarily loud voice. She sends spoon after spoon of porridge over, as if to prevent Mae from asking what Landon means.</p><p>The ward door is thrown open.</p><p>Lily stands in the doorway on crutches, panting with effort. She looks up and around the bright room, and limps in as fast as she can, hopping over the last few meters. Julia and Max retreats just in time as Lily drops her crutches and throws herself onto Mae. Mae draws a sharp breath and winces.</p><p>“I’m sorry.” Lily mumbles, balancing on one foot. “I’m so sorry.”</p><p>“I see you got off the wheelchair.” Landon says.</p><p>“About time, too.” Lily sits down on the edge of the bed with her back turned to Mae and Julia. She casts a swift glance at Mae’s arm, grabs the plaster and squeezes it.</p><p>“What’s wrong?” Mae asks. “Are you alright?” Lily remains silent. Mae looks at the others. “What happened?”</p><p>Julia, Landon, and Max look at each other and hesitate. Lily looks at the floor and says nothing. Mae sees a newly-healed scar exposed on the back of her neck under her black ponytail. Outside the door Lily’s mother appear, and behind them, Mae sees the small figure of her own mother, pale and frail. “Lily?” She whispers. “Tell me, please?”</p><p>“How are you feeling, dear?” Lily’s mother comes in and kisses Mae.</p><p>“What happened to Lily?” Mae asks.</p><p>“I fell down! Please!” Lily pleads. Lily and her mother look at each other for a long moment. Mae can’t see her friend’s face but her mother looks conflicted. Catherine walks to a corner and sits down, far from Mae’s bed. Julia, Landon, and Max decide to busy themselves with feeding Mae the rest of her lunch.</p><p>“Please don’t take the wrong way, Mae,” Lily’s mother begins. “She just doesn’t want you to blame yourself. Seeing what happened to you that night didn’t sit well with her, either.” Lily pulls her knees to her chin and squeezes her eyes shut. “She covered Richard’s blows for you.”</p><p>“Right after we got home, mom got an emergency call from you.” Comes Lily’s muffled voice. Mae blinks. “You were crying for help – the phone recognized that. It was cut off fast. I think your phone broke.”</p><p><em>From my fall? Well, that’s that with my phone, then. Less than two weeks of service.</em> Mae thinks.</p><p>“I ran over to your house.” Lily breaks off. Her mother lays a hand on her head.</p><p>“And that was probably when she saw you and threw herself over you.”</p><p>“I was ahead of mom and dad. I think later dad managed to overpower Richard Murray.”</p><p>“Lily was just in time.” Her mother finishes. “The last few blows were particularly furious. They fractured her hips and broke her leg. The neighbors apparently called the police. We found the injured man and sent Lily and him to Alvar hospital. Your condition was too severe and you were brought here.”</p><p>Mae sees her mother sits in her chair looking at the floor like a statue. This can’t be the first time <em>she</em> hears of the story, can it? The mister from the car and Lily threw themselves in her father’s way, but her mother seems to have done little from the start.</p><p>“Thank you.” Mae moves her arm to Lily, who grabs onto the plaster again. “I’m –”</p><p>“I made a choice.” Lily says thickly into her knee. “So did that man.”</p><p>“There’s nothing more natural than buying one’s father a present, even if that decision comes with consequences.” Lily’s mother says. “Nobody in here did wrong other than Richard.”</p><p>The door slides open for a third time. Lily’s father comes in, his face mirthless - scary, even. He looks around.</p><p>“Everyone’s here. How are you, Mae? That’s a pretty wig.” He gives her and her friends a quick smile and says to his wife, “Ryan and Diane did <em>not</em> take the news well. Said I should’ve told them earlier.”</p><p>“That can’t be helped. Don’t want them charge in with Mae unconscious.” She says. “And the hearing?”</p><p>“Cate needs to make a decision. Right now.” He’s more serious than Mae has ever seen him. “It’s the holidays next week and the court’ll be closed until January. It’ll also be much more difficult once Richard gets inside.” Lily unfurls herself and turns to Catherine, as with her parents. The rest looks as puzzled as Mae is. “I’m sorry to pressure you, but it’s been long enough. You need to make a decision, your god or your daughter and yourself.”</p><p>Max is the first to understand, but Julia is the one who dares voicing it.</p><p>“Are you going to divorce?”</p><p>Mae hears her mother give a shaky gasp, and realizes that she has been weeping all this time, perhaps since she sat down. For the first time Mae is watching her mother cry.</p><p>“I’m sorry. I’m not that brave –” Catherine sobs.</p><p>“You’re brave enough to consider divorce already. What do you people say?” Lily’s father asks the kids.</p><p>“Hell yeah.” Landon says. Julia and Max nod in agreement.</p><p>“Besides, you gave Mae almost half of your blood as well as your bone marrow without even hesitating. If that’s not brave I don’t know what is.” He crosses his arms. Mae finally understands why her mother looks so pale. He turns to her, “Yeah, she’s just out of hospital herself. You’ve lost too much blood, sweet.”</p><p>Lily’s mother walks over and crouches before Catherine’s hunched figure. She places a hand on her arm.</p><p>“Cate, you have already made the decision, didn’t you? You just need to summon that courage and say it.”</p><p>“What if he comes for revenge?”</p><p>“We’ll be there.”</p><p>Catherine sniffs and nods.</p><p>“I will press it.”</p><p>Lily’s mother breaks into a smile of relief and Lily’s father whistles.</p><p>“Great! We’ll go sign it in the afternoon, then. Makes the scolding from Mae’s grandparents much easier to bear. Now what’s up with my girl?” Lily’s father grins.</p><p>“She fell asleep.” Mae says.</p><p>“That was fast. She can finally sleep well, I think. Been having nightmares about you every night. It really wasn’t a pretty sight…” He picks up Lily’s crutches and leans them against the bed, and crouches down to level his eyes with Mae’s. His hitherto hard expression softens. “You’re tough, Mae. Not sure about you, but I’m glad you’re alive.”</p><p>“That’s what I said.” Landon stretches. “See, that’s what everyone says.”</p><p>“Go figure.” Lily’s father gives Landon a fist bump across the bed. “Anyone want lunch? Come on, kids. Iris? Cate?”</p><p>“You go.” Catherine says to Lily’s mother, who nods and stands up. They left.</p><p>Outside the window is the drifting snow. Inside the ward is equally silent. Mae avoids looking at her mother, and stares at Lily hunched at the edge of her bed, sleeping, instead. <em>How can she even hold up the posture for so long?</em> As soon as she finishes the thought, Lily sways and falls sideways onto the bed, and sleeps on. Mae peers at her neck. The scar she saw earlier was just one of many. She had stitches, too.</p><p>It’s because of her and that mister from the car that she’s alive. And perhaps her mother. Yes, her mother. It seems that everything will end well for them, at least. Yet Mae can’t help but feel there’s one piece missing.</p><p>Catherine moves her chair next to Mae’s bed with an effort, breaking her thoughts, and sits staring at Mae’s wrist. <em>Hm?</em> Mae looks at her.</p><p>“Richard’s in custody. I should let you know.” Catherine starts, voice thick. “The man that tried to help you was a police officer off-duty. I don’t know how that’ll be taken into account.”</p><p>“Right.” Mae manages to say. <em>No, this isn’t it…</em></p><p>“Will you forgive me?” Catherine starts again, almost timid. “For being a bad mother?” Mae looks up and meeting her mother’s big eyes. She looks like she has been through a lot in the past month, too. It’s rare to find anything in her eyes, usually, other than terror. “I was always too scared to stop him. Will you forgive me?”</p><p><em>I don’t know. And this isn’t what’s missing, either.</em> Mae thinks. She asks instead, “Were you scared? During the bone marrow transplant?”</p><p>“It was the least she can do,” comes Lily’s drowsily voice. Mae jumps. When did she wake up? “You need to earn her forgiveness.” She flips around, legs dangling over the side of the bed, looking groggily at Catherine.</p><p>Lily is known for her directness that borders harshness, but Mae is still surprised that she takes it to an adult. She’s even more surprised by her mother dipping her head in earnest and obedience. Lily sighs and flings an arm over Mae’s body. Mae winces, and Lily falls asleep again.</p><p>“Mom. There’s something in my bag that’s wrapped in blue paper.” Mae mumbles. “It’s for you. I hope it didn’t break when I dropped it.”</p><p>“We’ll open it together when you are home. For now –” She hesitates.</p><p>It’s long overdue, the kiss that her mother plants on her forehead. </p><p><em>There.</em></p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Before us is a door, and beyond that, the stage. On the stage is the dark red velvet curtain pulled shut, and on the other side, we know, is whatever is out there. I stand beside Mae in her chair. She seems to be chewing her lips.</p><p>"It'll be the time soon." I say to her. "Are you alright?"</p><p>"Not really." She turns to me, big green eyes full of anxiety. "Do I look appropriate?" She's in a white cashmere sweater and white woolen dress. She sits on the cushioned chair with only the pointed toes of her brown semi-combat boots touching the floor. She hates heels so there aren't any. I knew Ryan would puff out his chest and say, "She picked out everything herself!" Indeed she did. Her flame-red hair is tied, not in the hair bun her mother forces to wear all the time, but the crown braid the Lius fixed for her, which she loves.</p><a id="more"></a><p>I look down at myself. Red hand-knit sweater with the right sleeve cuff breaking apart and a yarn-sewn patch at the left elbow. Blue-white plaid shirt sticking out of the bottom of the said sweater. Straight-fit jeans with its denim flaking off at the seams. Dirty sneakers that I should've washed last Winter Solstice. My black hair tinted red under the full-spectrum light above the backstage is too long, but not long enough to tie up, not to mention that I didn't wash it last night.</p><p>"I think I should ask that, heh heh." I laugh nervously. She giggles.</p><p>"I think you're fine."</p><p>"Then so are you."</p><p>And we fall silent, her looking at her knees as usual and I at the door.</p><p>"It's been... quite some weeks." She starts after a while. "I was forced to remember things I don't want to remember."</p><p>"I'm sorry." I apologize. "It reminded me of things I'd rather forget, as well."</p><p>"I guess we aren't that different."</p><p>"No, not really." I take a deep breath. "See, you and Lily, and Billy and Iris... all of you have something that I have. Presenting you lot out there is like presenting myself. Sometimes I have to be extra careful about what I say out there, and how I say it. Whatever you're feeling, I understand."</p><p>"Mm-hmm." She looks up. "So you... you've—?"</p><p>"Not as severe as you. Not as often. I'm sorry you have to go through that." I take a deep breath again. "But you're tough. You survived, and I don't think you've ever shed a single tear." I grin at her. "Much better than I did."</p><p>"There are other factors, though... Help from other places that -" She grins at me in return, "—we can't say. I wouldn't have made a full recovery—oh no, I wouldn't have made it to the hospital had Iris not..." She trails off.</p><p>"Nope, we can't talk about that. Gotta leave it to their imagination, and spare some eyerolls from Mr. McGlynn."</p><p>"What's your favorite part in this?"</p><p>"Other than writing it all down and editing it?" I make a pout. "Hmm... probably going to the mall. I like the Keats part. It's brilliant. <em>You're</em> brilliant. Keats is brilliant."</p><p>"Sometimes you needn't hold back sticking your own touch in here."</p><p>"No, I suppose not. What's yours? Your favorite part?"</p><p>"Shopping in the mall." She looks embarrassed. "Hey, and since nobody's listening... it's also Max and Julia feeding me lunch. Oh... what am I saying..." She covers her eyes. "...and mom kissing me for the first time."</p><p>"That you remember, at least." I look away. "Listen... I'm sorry about all that. I feel extremely bad about it. You don't deserve it at all."</p><p>"It's my dad, anyways." She says shortly. Then she uncovers her eyes, looking serious. "What is he like before that, or has he always been like that?"</p><p>"I actually don't know." I begin to wonder, too. "A violent alcoholic who's violent even without alcohol, coming from an apparently normal, non-violent family... See, if there's a character I don't like, then I don't tend to try figure them out. Oh, it's not the other way around, you should know. I don't know what your mother's like before, either."</p><p>"The god isn't as omnipotent as they say, huh."</p><p>"I never was one." I laugh.</p><p>"How long have you been doing this? Presenting everyone with you?"</p><p>"Years and years ago. But on this stage? Five, I think? Made it here on a whim and then decided to stick to it. Arrived at midnight and realized, 'Oh, it's Winter Solstice! Maybe I should do it every year.' Well, frankly at first I thought I'm doing it for my friends. Then I realized that I may not have that many. Then I realized again that I don't need to do it for others, that I'm enjoying it, however hard it is every year, finding the right people, finding the right experience, finding the right words, and even finding the right audience. The very first one was actually Iris and Billy. I got laughed at for presenting someone that's so similar to me, you know? They thought I was talking about myself... But only a true artist knows what the deal is. I'm sure you do." Mae smiles and nods. "Then I presented them again, and again, and thought, maybe I'll do them forever. Well, I found someone else. Someone I don't think you know."</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>"An old man and his dog. Er, his robot. It looks like a dog. Anyways, I'd say that's my best choice to date. Almost made it to some regional prize. But I guess I'm really not that good. Then there's last year. It... Well. I like them. William and Lindsay. I tend to find people like me, and they tend to share my last name. I don't know how to feel about that."</p><p>"I mean, if you're comfortable with it, I think it's fine."</p><p>"You really are kind, Mae."</p><p>"Keep talking. It keeps my mind off—" She points at the door.</p><p>"Right. So. They came to me in a dream. Also about dogs. I asked Mr. McGlynn about them. He gave me his usual oh-the-stake oh-the-drama morbidity. I did my best to incorporate them. Well. Sent it out. Mixed reviews I don't really trust. One prestigious editor let me down gently; 'doesn't pique his interest'. We both know what he meant, though, no? 'Your story's boring. Go find some other idiot to bother.'"</p><p>Mae pats my arm in comfort.</p><p>"This year might be worse, though. Who knows." I mumble.</p><p>"But you enjoy doing it."</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Then that's something right there."</p><p>The door swings open. Mae and I jumped. A cloaked figure comes in. The MC of the World, that's what Mae calls him.</p><p>"Hey you, yes you," he points at me. "You and Mae, get ready. The next time this door opens you're up. And, you," he points at me again, "do something about your hair!"</p><p>"Shut up about my hair!" I snap. "I'm not doing anything about it until after the first month of the new Lunar year! And yeah, I got a name, dammit!"</p><p>But he already went out and pulled the door shut. Mae is wearing a weird smile at me: half-laughing at our exchange and half-grimacing at the news.</p><p>"Okay. Okay." I breathe. I bite my lips. I crouch down beside Mae's chair. "Okay." Pep talk, for her and for me. "Okay. We've worked hard in the past two weeks. We slept late. We doubted ourselves. We patted ourselves on the back for the good parts. We were close to breaking down remembering those things. We went over the whole thing three times, and they say third time's the charm. We gave it our best. We are tough and we made it through on time. Okay? Okay.</p><p>"Even after five years I still have no idea what's out there. For all of our work, there might be nobody out there. There might also be people roasting us—"</p><p>"What if they are firing at me? Calling me Mary Sue?"</p><p>"Last time I checked, Mary Sue never knew of the life you know. Mary Sue is an idiot since her creation, but Mary Ann, you, Mae, you are an angel. Okay? Okay. If you call me god, then you're an angel. No arguing. Besides, if they fire at you, I'll take it for you like Lily did. I'll-I'll even fire back. Yeah, I'll fire back..." I repeat to myself. "Yes. I shall defend you."</p><p>"I'm sorry I can't do much for you as well..." She looks suddenly downcast.</p><p>"No. You're here to keep me happy, and that's good enough. You, Lily, Billy, Iris, Julia, Landon, Nar'fiius, many others I presented—everyone. It's great. I-I—"</p><p>"Here..."</p><p>Mae gets off her chair and hugs me tight. I screw my eye shut and let it flow.</p><p>"I'm sorry about making you go through all that." I say again. "And just now I was supposed to comfort you."</p><p>"I'm scared." She looks into my eyes. "You are, too, huh."</p><p>"Every single time."</p><p>"But this is the first time you say something about it to the people you present."</p><p>"First time to record it, as well. And that makes this special, I guess."</p><p>"More bearable?"</p><p>"Yes. We are in this together."</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>I steel myself, and so does Mae.</p><p>"Mary Ann Murray." I say.</p><p>"Billy Liu." She says.</p><p>"It's our turn." We nod to each other.</p><p>The door swings open and the MC of the World—others call him Time; I call him Fate—poor guy, really, only a cloak and bones after all those time; every time I see him I want to smash him into bits for making me suffer—do you know, that people doesn't even know if he really is a "he"? Maybe he's a "she" and maybe he's like <em>C. elegans</em>, <em>hermaphroditic</em>, and maybe he's genderless—but I digress. The MC of the World as per Mae beckons his skeletal hand and says,</p><p>"Quickly! Quickly! The Winter Solstice is upon us!" and he holds the door open.</p><p>I stand up and hold a hand out for Mae. She takes it, smiling through her wet eyes.</p><p>"Be brave. Be tough." She says.</p><p>Our thin figures pass through the door. Beyond that is the silent velvet curtain. It's quiet. It's dark. We can hear the beating of our own hearts. We stand waiting, hand in hand, and our hands begin to sweat.</p><p>"Oops." Mae and I smile at each other.</p><p>The curtains part without warning and brilliant light floods over us.</p><p>This is it.</p><p>This our turn.</p><p>"<em>Hello, World.</em>" We say.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>"Do you think he'll be home when we get back?" Lindsay asks behind the wheels. Cars glide through the streets of Kanten Av Skogen before her in the long Scandinavian winter night, the noise of their engines muffled by the thin mist flooding the town. Early Scandinavian winter brings an early evening; only a layer of glass keeps the chill at bay.</p><p>"He will. Don't worry. Charlie always comes back from his wanderings before six. He's smart even for a dog." William soothes her.</p><a id="more"></a><p>Red light.</p><p>"How does he tell the time? I always wonder if he actually knows how to read."</p><p>"There's the church bell." William points at the silhouette of a steeple blocks away. "We usually get back around the time it strikes six."</p><p>They drive down the street. A few straggling leaves hang on the branches, cold, damp, helpless. The month-old leaf carpet on the sidewalks were cleaned up yesterday, and today the cement looks too bare. The entire town seems to be in slumber. Lifeless.</p><p>"Look, life." William murmurs, contradicting her thoughts. She turns in surprise.</p><p>To their right, a small group of children run past a lamp post towards the crossing, their bright yellow and red and blue winter jackets making up for the colorless day. Two women follow them, each holding a smaller child by hand. The darker-skinned mother's call comes through the window, telling her son to stop leading the group onto the street. The black boy running before the others stops a good distance from the edge. They stood babbling. Two girls giggle behind their hands, and the boy in front of them whips around and snaps at them. The other mother has to walk over to break them up. Lindsay can almost see their voice cutting through the air. With it come the thoughts from the black mother and Lindsay catches them: a sense of pride for her son to lead the group of and a slight regret of him not being the one to break up the bicker. Telepathy: it is as natural as sight and hearing for William and her.</p><p>"Imagine us becoming part of a neighborhood pick-up group." William gives a small laugh. "I'll have a hard time keeping them down."</p><p>"You don't have to." Lindsay says, her amber eyes glued to the group.</p><p>"How was lab?" He asks.</p><p>"Pfft. The antibody today is just a nuisance. Hypersensitive to temperature and concentration. Amped up the antibody concentration today and I was lucky to finish it before lunch. This means I'll have to go back after dinner to do the rest."</p><p>"I can go back for my PCR results, too - it'll be good to save some time for tomorrow morning." He reaches over and swipes a strand of her disheveled blond hair behind her ear. "We'll have to sneak Charlie in, then."</p><p>The car pulls into the driveway, and they get into the house.</p><p>Musky warmth wraps around them and draws them in, saying its welcome. This two-story house has been their home for the past five years. They step into its red brick walls and William flicks on the light, taking in the familiar yellow walls and dark red wooden doors. Lindsay hangs her coat and scarf in the closet on left and goes into the guest toilet next to it. Down the hall is the door to the study, and to the right is the archway to the living room. Through this William enters and looks around. Everything is still. He moves to the joint kitchen and dining room, passing the TV, the sofa, and the fireplace, and then back to the long end table in front of the TV. In the wall mirror behind the sofa he sees the thin, bespectacled reflection of a black-haired young man of 29 returning his frown, his willow leaf-shaped eyes wide with alarm.</p><p>"Charlie?" He calls. From the hallway comes the sound of flushing. He goes back into the kitchen, checking the dog bowls and the flap on the back door. The flap is on the outside.</p><p>"He's not in the study." Lindsay calls.</p><p>"Nor the kitchen, either," he replies. "The flap is still out. He isn't back." <em>A dog can't get lost, can it?</em> Lindsay joins him in the living room, and in silence they head upstairs.</p><p>The two empty spare bedrooms, the shared bathroom, their own bathroom—nothing. Back in their own room Lindsay crouches down next to Charlie's untouched blankets. When did he leave? The dog has been in there last night, but was gone before they were up. William sits down on the bed, and Lindsay asks without turning,</p><p>"Is his bowl empty?"</p><p>"Just how I left them last night." He replies simply, sitting at the edge of the bed, elbows on knees and chin supported by his hands.</p><p>"So he left without eating?"</p><p>"I suppose…" with that he wanders away in mind, leaving the ticking of their clock in his wake.</p><p>Lindsay isn't a stranger to silence. Ever since they've met it had been part of their lives. "The boon of an introvert," they would both joke sometimes. But the silence now is not the usual quietness, but a void. It gains weight with every <em>tick</em> from the clock a few meters away on the bed stand. Lindsay reaches out with telepathy. Outside, a passing neighbor is thinking about what to cook when she gets home. The Berg family is busy with their three children doing parkour throughout their house. Mrs. Olsen, their older neighbor, is knitting and thinking about the snowfall later in the evening. They are effortless to read, just mundane thoughts drifting around like dandelion fluffs in wind.</p><p>No thoughts of Lindsay's or of their neighbors' manage to revive William, however. The pang of worry from the thought that Charlie had left empty-stomach snaps into a dark thought. <em>Did someone snatch him away when he was relieving in the yard?</em> No, it couldn't be. Kanten is safe, and there are dogs more valuable that a gold retriever around. Who with a sound mind would steal a dog in the winter, anyways? As if the dog can't bark. <em>Then he left willingly? Why?</em> Before he knew it, William reaches an even darker thought: Charlie knows he's dying and he left to die, alone… <em>Nah, he's just out of his puppy-hood.</em> And with that, his thoughts disperse, leaving him in a trance.</p><p>A chime reverberates through the city, and the strike for six o'clock draws out in full, pulling him out of his reverie. His mind chimes along with the bell, three seconds between each "clang". When the echo of the last strike ebbs away he says in his soft voice,</p><p>"Six o'clock," as though he just woke up.</p><p>"Six o'clock." Lindsay echoes.</p><p>"Don't cry." He looks at her.</p><p>"I'm not."</p><p>"Let's have dinner first," he stands and lifts her up. "We can ask around the neighbors after that, and then head to the lab."</p><p>"No. No–You cook. I'm asking the neighbors right now."</p><p>"Just Mrs. Olsen and the Bergs, okay?"</p><p>"Don't fuss!" She's already at the bottom of the stairs.</p><p>"Hey I don't need you go missing, too!" William calls halfway down the stairs. He hears the click of front door. <em>For once I can't keep up with her.</em> He thinks and heads into the kitchen.</p><p>Rice needs 40 minutes to get ready. There's still more than half a pot of pork rib soup left. William checks the amount of tofu and carrots and napa cabbage inside, and remembered they ate most of the cabbages yesterday. He turns on first the exhaust and then the stove, and draws out from the freezer a small bag of side pork, sliced and seasoned. This he throws into a big bowl of hot water, muttering, "Should've thawed it in the morning." He considers thawing it with the fireplace, instead he gets out a small rack and a bag of bak choi.</p><p>As he snips the ends off of the small shoots William remembers the first time he ate with Lindsay's family. Around a table set with chicken soup, steamed broccoli, salad, and a huge bowl of rice sat her parents and her two younger sisters, Mikaela and Ruth. He felt awkward and overwhelmed, coming from a small Chinese family that doesn't eat dinner together often and his grandmother being his only dining companion. How surprised she would be had she known what were on the dinner table of an American family. No pizza or pasta or fancy steaks, but food so normal that she would scoff at.</p><p>Done with the snipping, William checks on the side pork. Half thawed. Ice-packed on the inside. <em>Icy,</em> he thinks with bitterness. His mother used to call him that. <em>Only to her. Mom was never too caring a mom, either.</em> No one in his family is telepathic. Not that it would help much, he knows, but William can't help but delude himself that had it been otherwise, his relationship with his parents would have been much better. At least then, they'd have something in common, a connection more concrete than blood.</p><p>The sound of boiling and the fragrance of pork, tofu, and carrot reach him. "Grandma's recipe," as he always introduces the soup. She who taught him cooking, the chef in the family. She was a chef of a restaurant for decades in her younger days, known for her recipes. Those imprecise "pinches" of salt and "couples" of garlic and some "whiles" of simmering kept him warm in winters regardless where he was, be it China, America, or Norway. When his parents' divorce broke the family apart, her meals kept the surviving mothers and son together. Cooking her recipes makes William feel at home, and he often wonders whether meals are essential for a family. To sit down together and eat, and talk about the day or the past or the future, a symbol of peace and reunion. When his father was home, as he seldom was, he'd often tell William off for not eating meat or scold William for the way he held his chopsticks during meals. His grandmother never failed to fire up and tell his father to shut up and eat. "Take your bickering elsewhere! This is our family's dining table!"</p><p>He turns down the fire to simmering and the pork ball finally thaws out. He rips open the bag and spreads them at the bottom of the bowl, and then washes his hands and the bak choi leaves. Dirt smears the sink.</p><p>Grandma was always home. His father was elsewhere most of the time, either getting his PhD or working as a postdoc, staying at home for three months at a time at most. His mother, the <em>de facto</em> breadwinner before her divorce, was usually out there working. She was the material matron, but what was good with material alone? Is she still a qualified mother if she didn't care for him? His father called weekly while he was away, but without his presence he was only a disembodied voice fussing about things that he either disagrees or could never help with. He can't be a parent if he's absent, and when he was present, so were harsh criticisms and beatings caused by small mistakes or a wrong word. Slowly William stopped revealing much to him, be it over the phone or in person. He doesn't need to know.</p><p>"What is a parent?" William asks the cleaned bak choi leaves. "Is it someone who feeds me or someone who gives birth to me? Is my grandma my parent, or my grandparent?"</p><p>Silence.</p><p>The front door clicks, faint over the sound of water and the simmering soup. Lindsay makes a beeline to the stove, inhales, and without a word lifts the lid and fishes out a rib with a ladle. William watches in amusement as she gasps in pain from the heat, puffing. She first drops the lid back on with a <em>clang</em> and then the rib into the ladle, fanning her burnt hand at her burnt tongue. William drags her hand under the tap and fans her mouth himself.</p><p>"No hot tofu for the hasty ones, Lin," he recalls an old Chinese idiom. "That was fast. I thought it'd take you a while." He pulls the bak choi bowl aside. "No luck?"</p><p>"No," Lindsay takes a bite at the rib again, "it's dinnertime, and they're all eating. I got hungry… Do you think Charlie knows how to hunt?"</p><p>"No." He decides to be honest. "Here, finish that bit and I'll cook the veggies. We'll put up some fliers before we leave, okay?"</p><p>"Hopefully we can finish our work early enough to look for him ourselves."</p><p>"Yeah." William isn't convinced. "How's the rib? Not overcooked, are they?"</p><p>"Grandma's recipe." Lindsay says, eyes closed and chewing.</p><center>**</center><p>"Rule number one in labs: nothing works." William scowled when they get back later in the evening. "Rule number two: if something worked, it was pure luck."</p><p>"Ugh." Lindsay replies, "at least those aren't human errors… or stupidity. Count on lab techs to chuck your stuff away. I'm off for a shower."</p><p>It's almost 11. William drops into the sofa and takes out his phone. He scrolls through his messages and feeds out of pure habit. His family and most of his friends are either on the other side of the continent or the other side of the ocean. Nothing new has come up since lunch except for a friend located in Scotland showing off the airplane engine his team finished working on. There are photos of cars on flooded streets, pictures of passages from books, cat gifs, news on a new regulation for internet news censorship, and his friend's small daily achievements. His mother has photos of her and his grandma out by the sea (<em>bless her years,</em> he thinks, <em>a near centenarian looking like in her late 70s. Mom's been taking her out more and more now.</em>). His childhood friend, Tong, shows off his baby daughter. William studies it: the baby's face is a perfect replica of his friend's when the latter was a boy. Back home they say the daughter resembles the father, and William wonders what his daughter (if he ever wants to get one) would look like. Perhaps her hair would take an explicit brown tint after her mother's blond hair, or she might have his willow-leaf shaped eyes.</p><p>The sound of the bathroom door from upstairs pulls William out of his thoughts. He is taken aback for a moment as his telepathy starts to connect him with the world around him—distant, unintelligible thoughts from his neighbors and pedestrians blocks away whisper softly in his mind. If he tries just a little harder, he could read them clearly, and perhaps even sense minds of those living at the edge of the town. <em>The collective unconsciousness would probably be real if everyone is telepathic.</em> He thinks. <em>But it does come with prices.</em></p><p>William gets up and changes the bowl of dog food and water in the kitchen. <em>You never know. He might come back at night.</em></p><center>**</center><p>Lindsay wraps her arm around him at once when he gets in bed after his shower, holding onto him as if to merge with him, and he returns the pressure.</p><p>"It's snowing." She whispers.</p><p>His heart skips a beat. Charlie never go out on snow days alone. William can't even remember when their dog started walking himself. They raised it from a puppy, and walked him daily. Charlie started walking himself outside on weekends. <em>Maybe he's lonely.</em> There aren't that many dog owners around and he wanted to try his luck outside the neighborhood. William has a small hope that the dog met another and is taken in by her owner for the night. <em>Or he might be caught and sent to some stray dog shelter. I shall make a call tomorrow.</em> But for now, there's nothing they can do.</p><p>"Will," Lindsay murmurs, "what are you thinking?"</p><p>"Charlie, of course." He replies, "Nothing we can do right now, though."</p><p>"No." She agrees. "Anything new in your feeds?" <em>Anything,</em> she thinks, <em>anything to take my mind off our dog.</em></p><p>"My friend, Tong—do you remember him?"</p><p>"Yes, the one from your elementary school? Merry as a cricket?"</p><p>"That's him."</p><p>"What about him?"</p><p>"It's more about his baby daughter. Two years old today. Man you gotta see her face! Chubby like her dad's." He reaches for his phone and flips to the feed. The nine bright photos bloom onto the screen all at once. On one, the baby is squinting or maybe smiling or even bawling at the camera. On another, she sits in her mother's lap wearing a set of floral full-body baby pajamas, and her laughing mother is holding a birthday hat just out of the baby's reach. They go on and on, with the baby in the hat, the hat in the cake, the baby's face in the cake, the mother's and the father's faces in the cake… <em>What a happy family,</em> William thinks, <em>Don't know how Tong managed it. Wonder what it feels like?</em></p><p>"All babies are alike. Cute." Lindsay snorts.</p><p>"Look at that round nose and the chubby cheeks. They are signature Tong." William prods the screen. "And look at that chin and those eyes and them small earlobes. No one else has them except her mom. I do hope she also has her mother's brains, ha ha." He strokes her hair.</p><p>"Don't be a jerk. She'll merge the best of everything. What's her name again?"</p><p>"Xingyan. Literally means a look like the stars above."</p><p>"I'll take it to mean 'bright and shiny', I suppose… Sounds like Celeste."</p><p>"Don't know what they had in mind when they named her, but I'll pass Celeste along if she ever needs an English name." William shrugs. "Say, if we ever have a kid, what do you think she'd look like?" He feels her heartbeat becomes quicker through layers of pajamas.</p><p>"I can't even imagine her hair color. It could be anywhere between my blond to your black."</p><p>"Or maybe a blend of our eye shapes, a bit round and slanted down at the outside but with pointed ends."</p><p>"But the nose will be the same round one." She says loftily.</p><p>"Hope she got your chin, though."</p><p>"Pfft. She'd better. Yours is too straight." Lindsay looks at the window curtains.</p><p>"That's racist." He jibes.</p><p>"Urgh don't get me started." She rolls her eyes.</p><p>"Almost makes me want to have one just to see her." William said without thinking, distracted again by Tong with his face in the cake.</p><p>Lindsay opens her lips to speak, but stops. With a confused frown, she buries her head between his shoulder and the pillow. <em>What's wrong?</em> William thinks. Lindsay reaches over, flicking off the light and planting a kiss on his lips at the same time.</p><p>"Alright, dreamtime." He plugs his phone.</p><p>Lindsay says nothing. She buries her head back into his shoulder and in a minute, William hears her soft breathing. Her head sinks deeper and slips onto the pillow. William lies awake staring at the ceiling that's swallowed by the night, wondering what's on her mind. No help from telepathy.</p><p>Telepathy. <em>"Communication from one mind to another by extrasensory means". Merriam-Webster.</em> He recites to himself. <em>The communication of impressions of any kind from one mind to another, independently of the recognized channels of sense. OED.</em> Communication. Extrasensory. Beyond or outside ordinary senses. What's more important in this definition, communication or extrasensory? <em>If I can't communicate but only perceive, does it still count?</em> In the dark, William revisits his own metaphor for telepathy: one with telepathy—the telepath—is like a human mirror. The mirror sees what anything that passes by is (<em>Perception,</em> he says to himself). The passerby, however, can only see his own reflections when he (<em>—or she, does it matter? —</em>) looks at the mirror, but not the mirror itself. If the mirrors want to, they can distort the reflection into whatever they want, and might even convince the passerby that the distorted reflections are accurate depictions, and the passerby will walk away with a thought, or an idea… such as they have a long face, or their legs are uneven, or they are small and insignificant… (<em>Injection,</em> he recites). Furthermore, if the mirror is enticing enough, the passerby might lose the "self", forgetting that he or she is the original, and mimic what the reflection does… (<em>…and Manipulation.</em> He adds.)</p><p>But what happens when the mirrors meet each other?</p><p>William feels a tinge of sorrow whenever he reaches this point.</p><p><em>An endless tunnel of mirrors reflecting mirrors… no matter how they move and distort the reflection. That's how they know: who they are and who themselves are.</em></p><p>Darkness thickens, and William isn't sure whether his eyes are open anymore. He feels the thick quilt over him, he feels the warm body next to him, and he feels the soft mattress under him. <em>But no matter how hard I try I can't—</em></p><center>**</center><p>Lindsay wakes up to a stiff cheekbone. The room is still dark, and it takes her a moment to realize that half of her face was stuck against William's shoulder all night. She shuts her eyes and groans.</p><p><em>For god's sake get some exercise and grow some muscles…</em></p><p>What she knows about energy and biological development tells her that all telepaths should be slimmer than average as a result of the extra energy required for the extra sensory. What she knows about evolutionary development tells her that such high-cost of energy would've made it near impossible for the trait of telepathy to be passed down, especially in the early days when food is scarce. What her daily life tells her that had it not been coffee, such high energy cost will make her drowsy all the time.</p><p><em>But none of this is an excuse for your physique. You're literally bony. Besides, your telepathy requires much higher energy input than average, and you don't even eat that much. How do you stay awake in the day? You hate coffee.</em> She takes in his scent and turns around. <em>If it's hard to be inherited and less fit, then any telepathy would be a result of mutation. But how many genes? Is this vestigial? Are we lucky to have it?</em></p><p>She remembers the day, when she was seven, she gathered her family to the living room.</p><p>"Everyone, I have news." She said in a matter-of-fact tone. Her sisters, Mikaela and Ruth, six and four, sat up straight and looked at her with solemn eyes. Her parents grinned at each other. Looking around, she said syllable by syllable, "I am telepathic."</p><p>"What's that?" Mikaela asked.</p><p>"I can read minds."</p><p>Her sisters' eyes went wide with wonder.</p><p>"Is that how you knew I wanted that barbie for my birthday?" Mikaela shouted. Lindsay nodded. She also knew Mikaela and Ruth both snacked on the ice cream in the fridge in midnight last week, after everyone was asleep, but right now she doesn't want to distract her parents' attention elsewhere.</p><p>Her father looked like he was bursting a rib from holding back laughter. He asked her what number he had in mind.</p><p>"Infinity isn't a number, dad."</p><p>"Okay then, that could be lucky." Her math professor father cracked up. "Let's try again."</p><p>"Can't you just play along?" Her mother elbowed him, annoyed.</p><p>"<em>I'm</em> not playing, mom. Dad, this isn't a number either, you said so—" Lindsay wasn't laughing the slightest when she wrote down _e__iπ_ <em>+1 = 0</em>.</p><p>Her telepathy changed little for their daily lives if Lindsay ignored the fact that her father made it a habit to ask her to "perform her psychic powers" and start ranting off about some obscure math theory. She soon realized that while she could read their minds, her family couldn't hear hers. They couldn't even tell where the idea came from when she puts one into their minds. Once she came home with her mind blasting "I got full marks on biology!" at her mother, her mother asked what was she so happy about, "Full marks in biology?" She nodded, and her mother would laugh, "See, I am telepathic, too!" Another time when she had a fever and, dying of thirst, she sent her father calls for water. He did come with a glass of water, but upon entering he drained it in one swift movement as though in reflex. "Oops, this was meant for you. I don't know why I keep drinking water even though I had a lot already." His apology was genuine. It was much later that she learnt from William his terms for these behaviors: "Perception", the passive receiving of mental activities, and "Injection", the ability to influence minds undetected.</p><p><em>Useless.</em> Lindsay thinks to herself. <em>Do I want to know that the Bergs think I'll be in their shoes with children a few years later, or that Mrs. Olsen thinks it's a waste of me not to have children?</em></p><p>Lindsay closes her eyes. <em>Well, I guess I'm around that age…</em> The only topic they both avoid talking about. Last night was unusual and Lindsay was too preoccupied with Charlie's disappearance to notice which way the conversation was heading. <em>How can I miss it? The subject has been going on all day, every day, in fact, from that pick-up group to the neighbors to Tong.</em> She doesn't want to admit to herself her fear of giving birth, and less so as a developmental biologist. Talks of having children remind her immediately of the mandatory reactions and processes she studied reluctantly for a year. It sounds painful. It looks painful. Her professor had showed them a video of herself giving birth when Lindsay was still a graduate student. Lindsay still run into her on the campus sometimes, and when she does, she can't help avoiding eye contact.</p><p>William has his own reasons to avoid the topic, and she guesses it has something to do with his family. He doesn't hide his past, but when he spoke of it, he was always stoic, as though he was talking about someone else's life. <em>I wish I know what they really are.</em> She thinks, turning around and curling up around him. <em>I wish you know what's with me, too. Have you wondered—? I can't even bring myself to talk about it.</em> She finds herself kissing him. <em>If only we can read each other's mind.</em></p><p>Loneliness wells up in her, and she clasps William's hand. He wakes up.</p><p>"Whassup? 'we late?"</p><p>Lindsay wordlessly reaches over him into the nightstand drawer and fumbles around. In the dim light he sees her amber eyes on his, and her hairs around her thin, soft face, cheeks a little puffy from sleep, asking for something. He understands.</p><center>**</center><p>The dull dawn greets her as she walks out of the door. The world is drained of its color. William is shoveling the snow in Mrs. Olsen's yard. The old lady stands on the doorsteps in a red woolen shawl. Lindsay walks to the fence between their yards.</p><p>"Have you any luck with Charlie?" She is asking. William shakes his head, puffing. "I'm sorry, dear. Lindsay came to ask about him last night—oh, there she is. Good morning, dear!" She nods and smiles, her face flushes with the cold, but her voice, though quivering with old age, brings warmth from her hearth.</p><p>"Morning, Mrs. Olsen. Are you doing well?" Lindsay says to the old lady, and then to herself, <em>Man, I really don't want to smile at you today, not after your fuss over children last night.</em></p><p>"I am. Sorry that I have to borrow William for a moment, dear. The snow…" Mrs. Olsen waves an arm at William carving away at the path to her door. Lindsay nods. Her neighbor goes on, "William doesn't talk much, but he's a good boy…reminds me of one of my sons…" Her two sons and a daughter all live and work in either Oslo or Drammen two hours away out in the south.</p><p>"The boon of an introvert." Lindsay squeezes a swift smile out of a grimace. <em>Her sons and her daughter, her grandson and her granddaughters. Give me a break.</em></p><p>William grins at Mrs. Olsen, embarrassed, and calls to Lindsay, "Be right there." He shoves the last few meters of snow with vigor, and lets out a long stream of breath. "There," He looks up, "take care walking out, ma'am. Actually, <em>don't</em> walk out. Give me a call if you need anything. There are still bits of ice."</p><p>"Thank you, William… Tell me," she looks first at him and then at Lindsay, and Lindsay sighs in her mind, <em>no…</em> "What are your plans for Christmas?"</p><p>"Uh?" William looks at her, eyes slightly narrowed. He perceives her plan of putting up a show of family love and egging them on with the matter of kids. "Don't have any."</p><p>"Not going home?" Mrs. Olsen peers at him. "My children and my grandchildren will be coming over. Why don't you join us? We'll be making cakes—"</p><p>Lindsay would've just said she'd think about it, but she sees William raises an eyebrow and tilts his head, putting on his sheepish good-boy smile. She recognizes the stance.</p><p>"—but oh right, you're lactose intolerant and we must have milk to make cakes…" Mrs. Olsen's face dropped. "You can always skip that and go for the roasted chicken—" William looks at his feet, smiling more. Mrs. Olsen falters "—you're vegan, now I remember… Oh, I guess I should've thought through this better! I'm sorry!"</p><p>"It's alright. I appreciate the invitation, though."</p><p>"We have to go. Take care, Mrs. Olsen!" Lindsay steps back from the fence quickly and beckons to William. The old lady opens and then closes her mouth, and shuffles back into her house, confused. William walks back to Lindsay's side, smirking like an idiot.</p><p>"<em>You're neither lactose intolerant nor a vegan!</em>" Lindsay hisses when they get into the car. "<em>Why did you do it?</em>"</p><p>"She's kind, but she always has her own agenda. Besides, she doesn't even know I influenced her."</p><p>"Learn some tact and tell her you'll think about it, Will, instead of abusing your telepathy!"</p><p>"Sensed her telling you what a waste it is for you not to have—" William breaks off, "Never mind."</p><p>Lindsay bits her lips and pretend not to have heard him.</p><center>**</center><p>In the late afternoon Lindsay brings one of the undergraduate student assistants over to her lab bench and says,</p><p>"OK, quick technique lesson on executing mice."</p><p>Molly, the undergraduate nods, face calm. But she still asks,</p><p>"For dissection?"</p><p>"That, and to prepare you for later things. People a floor above us use death as a means of control, stopping the brain activity at specific moments after treatment for comparison. For now, though, you'll be extracting the embryos for screening."</p><p>"Um…" Molly bites her lips and taking a long look in the cage on the lab bench. "I…"</p><p>"It'll be fast." Lindsay places a hand on the bench before Molly. "You'll be doing dissections a lot next semester in the vertebrate morphology class, with larger mammals. Consider this a prep, okay?" She winks and points to the cage. "Here are the two mice. The way to do it is simple. Put the mouse over the edge of the cage like this… see, they'll grab it with their front paws. Now, take their tail in one hand and place a finger behind its head, just in the nook of the neck. You can feel it. Ready?" She yanks briskly on the tail without even blinking. An inaudible <em>snap</em> whips the air. In her head she sees the light of life snaps out in the mouse's head. The mouse hangs limp and stretched between her hands like rubber. She lays the body on a plate behind her. "Your turn."</p><p>Molly takes out the other mouse with deft hands, keeping the squealing rodent under control, and latches it onto the cage bar. She holds it like Lindsay showed her and tugs. The mouse flounders its hind paws in protest, squealing. Molly stands there frowning at the mouse, rocking on her feet.</p><p>"It's hard at first for anyone. Do you want me to hold your hand through this one?"</p><p>She shakes her head. She gives the tail a slow tug or two to brace for it. The mouse has stopped squealing, but just hangs there, waiting. The absentminded tugs go on but Molly can't seem to summon up the resolve.</p><p><em>This won't do.</em> Lindsay watches. The sophomore has all the intelligence and diligence for the developmental biologist that she wants to be, but the real initiation to the field is the ability to grit one's teeth and do what's necessary, like killing experimental animals. <em>I guess I'll have to do Injection…</em> Trying to shake off the guilt of breaching her own moral, Lindsay follows a stream of _I can't_s into Molly's mind, and repeated her recent memory of killing the mouse. With each re-enactment she changes the features of herself little by little, morphing her appearance until the girl executing the mouse is not Lindsay but Molly. The same girl in reality follows the course of the memory, pulls and throws the mouse into a fit of pain. She gasps and snatches her hand back. Lindsay decides to take over, convincing herself that doing so is for Molly's own good. Grabbing Molly's mind with her own Lindsay jerks her hand behind her back. The girl's hand yanks the tail in response. The mouse goes out like a bulb.</p><p>"You did it." Lindsay pats her shoulder. "Good job!"</p><p>"Not sure how I managed it, though."</p><p>"It'll be easier next time." Lindsay smiles. "Now, dissection…"</p><p>They end a little before five. Molly bids her goodbye and leaves, looking much more relaxed. Lindsay collapses into a chair. Outside, the night is long fallen. She can only see the reflection of her lab in the window. From around the shelf of reagents William appears.</p><p>"Who was that Brit girl again?"</p><p>"Molly Gordon. Did her first dissection just now." Lindsay looks at the floor. "I had to Manipulate her with telepathy to kill it prior."</p><p>"Guilty?" William asks with a frown. They walk out of the lab.</p><p>"Guilty. It's as if the sole use for being a telepath is to influence others…"</p><p>They left together. Outside, in the horizon, a sliver of navy blue trims the heavy clouds that stretch over their heads against the dark sky, holding onto snow like a miser. Chimes of church bell floats over from the north, faint and solemn. William drives them down the campus hill, through the wet street lit by sparse lamps. The groups of children walking home are much quieter than yesterday, taking care not to slip. The life, the liveliness, like the lab mouse's mind, are out. Something nags Lindsay's mind. Charlie? A renewed sense of guilt floods down her face. She has not been thinking about the dog all day. No one contacted her or William from the flier they managed to put up last night, either.</p><p>"No news from the animal shelter?" She asks. He shakes his head.</p><p>"Called them. No dogs came in all week. If Charlie isn't home today, we go look for him."</p><p>"How?"</p><p>"Telepathy." William replies, rather embarrassed. "I've probed his thoughts once. He's definitely not always thinking of bones or walking around." Lindsay raises an eyebrow. "I was curious. Have to say, I had to get much closer to his mind to read it. See, dogs are colorblind, but when I touched his mind, it's like I had never seen colors before… A collage of ideas and sensations—confusing—surreal—<em>overwhelming</em>. At some point I started to wonder: if we can find and learn this pattern, maybe we can talk to Charlie. Isn't this a great idea? But then again, is this specific to him, or is it for all dogs? Hey, do you think it'd be easier to read dogs than other animals, since we co-evolved together?"</p><p>Their car now sails through the busy downtown, joining other cars and buses, past neat rows of shops and restaurants lighting up the town in futility. Wreaths of mistletoe and early Christmas lights hide the yet-to-be-filled tables behind the windows.</p><p>"Ironic, isn't it, that we can do so much with it." Lindsay's small smile at his excitement is ephemeral. She leans against the car window, voice quiet as though murmuring to herself. "We can perceive thoughts, we can plant or even control ideas, we can do it to any living thing if we try, but we can't do it to each other." She holds out a hand before her, pressing the air. "It's like we are separated by a sheet of glass." She looks at William's reflection. His face is impassive as usual. "I see you, but I can't touch you. At least in your mirror metaphor, they can still interact, however futile." They have arrived home. Lindsay unlocks their front door. "Not mine."</p><p>Darkness, warmth, and the still silence. Lindsay tries to sense for anything—any consciousness—in the house besides her own. Nothing. Her cellphone buzzes. She has not touched it all day. Below the new email about her bank statement is a message she missed. <em>Hi!</em> It says, <em>I saw your flier, and I saw your dog while taking my wife to the hospital yesterday. Saw him when we were parking there. A gold retriever, blue collar, white paws, long fur. It was following the road north. Hope this helps!</em> She replies her thanks and turns out of the door.</p><p>"Where to?" William asks.</p><p>"Past the hospital up north."</p><center>**</center><p>The flier didn't show Charlie's collar, which is indeed blue, so Lindsay is confident about the lead. Though the sighting was "yesterday", she tries not to lose hope. William drives slower than usual, so they can both scan the road for hints of their dog by sight as well as by telepathy, focusing on people's memories in the past two days and skimming through for signatures of dogs. They are crossing the line between the outer and the inner conscious, and Lindsay dislike taking such a drastic measure. It's equivalent to kicking down people's front doors and pulling open their drawers and wardrobes. She seeks comfort in the weak fact that they are leaving the bedroom door—the unconscious—alone.</p><p>"If he was around the hospital… That's out of the neighborhood." William murmurs.</p><p>The mist clings on. Among the grayish blue or grayish yellow houses, Lindsay only perceives exhaustion and hunger. Memories not her own drift through her mind, and she sifts through them like one through another's diary. These people will believe they are recalling those memories out of their own free will. They won't know why they are trying to remember; they won't even feel her presence. She keeps reminding herself this, however futile it is against the truth that she's breaching her own moral rules twice in a day. She also tries to reach out to William. What is she expecting, really, other than the all-too-familiar sensation of an arrow veering smoothly off course? She knows where to reach out: it's the island in the sea of psychological activities, the silence in the background noise; yet as she reaches out towards it, she's repelled. <em>Just like magnets, south pole to south pole and north to north.</em> She gives up probing altogether. <em>Maybe Charlie doesn't like to wander around; it's us pushing him away, leaving the house for our nine-to-five job and going back again for another eight-to-ten… No, he started going off on his own before that, when we spent most of our time writing papers at home.</em></p><p>"Why did we get a dog in the first place again?" Lindsay isn't really asking.</p><p>"We like dogs." He replies automatically.</p><p>"Right."</p><p>"Got anything?"</p><p>Lindsay shakes her head, her thick ponytail and strands of her fly-away hair whipping the car window.</p><p>"There's a guy calling his dad there about a dog, but not ours. Which reminds me," William stares ahead, "Dad called after lunch." He watches a man walking his son, around six or seven, home. "He was ranting again about my age and 'having an heir'—" <em>Heir,</em> Lindsay lists in her mind. <em>Son. Baby.</em> "—Told him we got work, ourselves, and a dog to take care of. He tells me to shut up with my excuses." At that, an aloofness creeps into his eyes. Lindsay wonders if he had a feeling like missing a step when going downstairs when he heard that, like she does. But he speaks it; so he doesn't?</p><p>She reaches out for him. Repelled.</p><p>His father's right, though. Getting Charlie as an excuse to postpone the decision on children is the reason they both wish to deny. If they lose Charlie for good, their excuse for not having children against their parents' incessant hinting and nagging is over. There's no way they will stop even if they get a new dog. William's father is already grudging against them having this one, if not against <em>her</em> for "not shouldering her natural responsibility" (or so he suggested to her once). Her own mother can't understand how having a dog can conflict with having a child. "If it's financial issues, we can help!" Lindsay smirks at this recollection. Did her mother help with her student loan? No.</p><p>In a yellow brick house under a red tiled roof up ahead Lindsay comes across the mind of a mother asking her 14-year-old daughter what she's so happy about. The girl says she made it into the cheerleader's squad. <em>Liar.</em> Lindsay thinks, amused. There's a much more important reason: being a cheerleader means she can get closer to the boy she likes on the soccer team. <em>Lady, even I know your daughter better than you do.</em> She tries at William again. <em>Futile.</em></p><p>"There's an old couple who saw Charlie going north yesterday, in that house there. He should be going towards the hospital then." William whispers. "We are on the right track."</p><p>The trees lining the street become thicker the further they go. Fuzzy orange orbs flare up between the bare branches, casting shadows that cobweb the ground. It's dinner time. Lindsay starts to smell their cooking from the minds she sifts through.</p><p>"Are you hungry, Lin?"</p><p>"No, are you?"</p><p>"No. I've been thinking…" He hesitates. Lindsay tells him to go on with her eyes. "Does it matter? Telepathy? So many families got along fine enough, and so do we."</p><p>"Don't you want to know the person you are giving your life to? It could've been—It's <em>supposed</em> to be the most intimate way of communication between people…"</p><p>"True. There are no lies in telepathy. But we've always been honest to each other."</p><p>"Yet there are things that words alone can't get through, things that are hard to even put into words." She adds to herself, <em>Like the discussion of having children between us, and your feelings about your family, and my fear of giving birth, and who knows what else you're hiding under there, like I am?</em></p><p>He doesn't respond.</p><p>They pass a wide street into a denser residential area. Around them, with people back in their homes, the town of Kanten comes alive. Pieces of Norwegian speech and clatter of forks against plates, sizzling water in oil and vented or ventless exhausts humming and churning, music from TV and computers and guitars and violins. Thus are the backgrounds of Kanten Av Skogen: the physical, the metaphysical, the mental. Its collective consciousness says <em>LIFE</em>: the mundane contradictions. Ice creams and hot pots; lights get flicked on and flipped off; the beauty and the ugliness. One family is in mourning of a deceased elder, its somber air challenged by another that's celebrating a toddler's birthday. In one passing house, a girl is spitting out spinach. In another, a boy is wolfing it down with relish. A couple is in tight embrace on the sofa, feeding each other dinner before TV. Another is fighting over a lipstick mark on a shirt collar, their dinner still frozen in the fridge. To the east Lindsay senses a homeless snoozing behind a trash bin in an alleyway, starving. Two blocks to his west William finds a man in suit-and-tie leaning at the foot of a telephone pole, wheezing from an asthma attack in the shadows.</p><p>"We need to help him." William says, pointing in the direction. He senses a car driving up to the telephone pole, and he calls out to the driver's mind. "Cold and the mist triggered it."</p><p>Mundane contradictions? Sure. Basic units of basic worlds colliding together to make the one world be. They can know what the entire city is doing if they wish to and react, yet they can't toward each other, or change their parents' minds. William doesn't see his father in person and thus can't Inject. Lindsay tried with her mother but in the end couldn't bring herself to it. Are these mundane contradictions or some divine joke? Are they part of the basic units or the outliers? Are there somewhere in the world other telepath couples facing the same contradictions or are they connected as though they share a soul?</p><p>William slows down as a car speeds past them, its emergency lights flashing.</p><p>"Our good Samaritan back there. The lady has an inhaler. The man'll be alright, I think—"</p><p>A door slams in the darkness ahead and interrupts him. Through the mist comes roaring of a man. They both jerk their heads towards it: a family of three. The teenage daughter just came back smelling of tobacco and marijuana, and the father is demanding her whereabouts.</p><p>"None of your business." Lindsay hears the girl snap in her mind. "I got back here before 7, so there!"</p><p>"Smelling like you pickled yourself in the red lights district, and you think I'll just let it pass?" The father pushes the girl back into a chair. They are speaking a Norwegian dialect, but Lindsay still understands due to her telepathy. "Who were you with?"</p><p>"What's it to you? I've had my fun and now I'm back on time! What more do you want?" The girl tries to push past but is barred down again.</p><p>"Erik, calm down!" The mother cries.</p><p>"I did not raise our daughter to be a stoner and a whore!"</p><p>They are approaching the household, and the shouting can be heard without telepathy. Instead their ability amplified the scraping of the chair on the floor, the smashing of mugs, a thump of a wallet against the sofa—</p><p>Lindsay feels six arms shoving, pushing, pulling, and wrestling. She doesn't know whose mind she is in anymore.</p><p>—bumps of a body thrown against the door, a whisk of a hand grabbing a broom up and a whack of another hand slapping it down—</p><p>The commotion and the anger make her heart race. A shiver of fear cut across them all. From whom?</p><p>"—discipline!"</p><p>"—get off me, you motherfu—"</p><p>A roar, the rattle of the door as the father and the daughter fights over the handle—</p><p>"Erik!"</p><p>A sound slap from both the house and her mind makes Lindsay recoil. She realizes the car has stopped, and turns to find William holding his left cheek, eyes wide with fire. She's almost scared to call him.</p><p>"The girl saw Charlie last night." Comes his thick reply.</p><p>"I—"</p><p>"It reminds me of my own beatings, that's all. Gimme a moment…" He sits with his elbows propped on the wheel and rubs his face in his hands, trembling. His reality is punctured by the voice of his father saying, <em>responsibility to your old dad and your blood!</em> and recollection of his childhood scolds and beatings and his suppressed fury at his helplessness: fighting back would only get his more punishment. The scenes flashing past are covered by a veil of red. He does his best to prevent himself from becoming violent. A tiny part of him that's not compromised by the shock figures that it's only a result of close contact with the minds of that family: only a resonance of heightened emotions similar to what he had experienced. He tries to shut out the commotions from that family. The emotions will pass.</p><p>At last, he sees himself screaming at his father, "<em>Responsibility to hell, you who are absent most of</em> my <em>life!</em>" and his grandmother banging the table at his father, "<em>Get OUT, you! Let the boy eat his meal! Don't tell</em> me <em>how to raise my grandson!</em>" The yells echo and die. The wheel, the seat, the car, and Lindsay's hand on his arm bloom back to existence.</p><p>"Did I just experience PTSD without trauma?" He gives a hollow laugh. "Ow. It hurts, Lin."</p><p>"Your knuckles are white." Lindsay doesn't let go of him, and wonders how he can laugh it off like that and what he saw. "Can you still drive? What did you see?"</p><p>"I'll tell you when we're home." He nods and drives on.</p><p>A few blocks later, a five-story building sprawls along the parking lot on their left, the red-bordered white cross at its top blurry in the air. The car slows to a halt at the side of the road. Lindsay sensed a few people in the hospital. One of the front desk assistants saw Charlie early in the morning, heading further north. The man who sent Lindsay the message is there, too, pacing head down on the third floor. Beside him are two anxious old people sitting on a bench. A bit further to their right stand a group of five bending over a woman—</p><p><em>Third floor, the obstetrics department?</em> Lindsay freezes. Her mind falls right into the laboring woman's mind like iron to a magnet. The contact makes her squeeze her eyes shut. She can't back out. Rhythmic and lingering pain work their ways through telepathy into her mind and creeps down her body. When she opens her eyes they are not her own but the woman's. Five people in blue crowds by her crotch in a well-lit room. She shrinks away from them but her legs remain open and outstretched.</p><p>"Okay… push. Push! C'mon…" She hears through the woman's ears, too. She gasps the woman's gasps. Pain. "Yes, that's it, again! Okay… Again!"</p><p>The pain is becoming acute with each expansions and contractions. She's being ripped apart and it doesn't stop there. The wife chants feverishly to herself, <em>I'm going to die I'm going to die I'm going to die</em>, and Lindsay echoes, <em>make it stop make it stop oh mom get me out of her!</em> To her horror, her memory of her mother replies, <em>it'll be over soon, honey. You'll love what comes out of it later.</em> A new stroke of pain splits her from head to foot and she can't tell who's screaming. Sweat is rolling down her head, and it hurts—her mind hurts. She can't back out no matter how much she tries. She's digging her nails into the bed sheet and her thighs, unable to tear anything apart.</p><p>"It's out. The head. You two, birth assist. Get ready. Easy—"</p><p>Gloved hands thrust into her and she gasps in shock. Another pair rubs her belly. Somewhat surreal, she feels yet another pair wraps around her shoulder in another body. They all pull. Lindsay—or the woman—struggles to keep the contraction at bay and to remain conscious, forcing down screams. A sensation of relief bursts as the baby comes through. Like plug out of a drain Lindsay jerks and find herself sweating and gasping and crying in William's arms, curled into a ball, her whole body in spasms. Her first reaction is to feel between her legs to make sure nothing triggered her period early. <em>Good. Nothing.</em></p><p>"I'm here, dear. I'm here." William strokes her hair. "We're both here, Lin. It's alright. I thought I lost you." He's sweating, too. There was nothing he could do to help.</p><p>"How long was I out?"</p><p>"No idea. What was it? That woman?" He strokes her head, and she grits her teeth, trying not to cry more.</p><p>Darkness outside. Orange fuzzy light. Dim outlines of trees and cars and buildings. Warm air from the AC. These things the woman on the third floor in the hospital cannot see and needs not to see. She takes comfort in her newborn, not in the world. Lindsay stays curled in William's arms for a long time, sweating and trembling, thinking of nothing.</p><center>**</center><p>At last she lets out,</p><p>"Let's keep going," and he doesn't protest.</p><p>Misty shadows of the trees climb over their windshield and houses fall back, but Lindsay isn't scanning them anymore. They have lost Charlie already, she's sure. There's something they have to discuss, more urgent than their lost dog, and more important than philosophizing a perhaps vestigial trait. They can't avoid the topic any longer. The road runs past the last houses and into the muffled woods. It ends in a pebbly clearing served as a parking lot. A lonely lamp throws a dim glow into nowhere.</p><p>Lindsay leans over and gives William a long kiss. She musters up the strength to whisper, "Be back soon," and staggers out of the car and into the woods.</p><p>What can William say? Lindsay's hair is undone; either she didn't notice or she doesn't care. He waits until the swishing gold and her small form dissolves in the darkness ahead before shedding his glasses and collapsing onto the wheel, drawing out a long, muffled scream. His left cheek still tinged. It took his all to make light of the encounter with the family, not to mention to continue driving. He's used to keeping down the pain inside; he doesn't want to disappoint. Still, William is grateful for her to give him some moments to succumb. <em>I wish I could tell her this, but there's no way for it to come out right. Yes, she's right. Telepathy would make this much easier.</em></p><p>If only there's a way to reach her mind and dump everything he can't put into words in there, and vice versa. But they are mirrors; all they can share through telepathy is the solitude of being telepaths, the glaring fact that they can read everyone else but no one can read them, not even one another. That was how he knew <em>what</em> she was but not <em>who</em> she was the first time they met. He couldn't overlook how her mind repelled his. It was at that moment when he understood despair: the unending and persistent tunnel that bounces between the mirrors, the knowledge that he would never learn the girl sitting before him as well as he can with any other people. The thrill of finding someone who is what he is? Drowned in that tunnel. He had long stopped trying to probe her mind, tired and afraid of the futility. He's lucky to have met her. It has been too lonely. Perhaps in the past, telepaths were driven mad in the end, and few had descendants. The mental impacts, the energy consumption, the limited social function—all of these point to the ill fitness of telepathy. Yet it resurfaces throughout history, and no doubt admired by many, enshrined in science fictions as the ultimate evolution. <em>How boring would that be, though, everyone being telepathic.</em> He wipes his eyes and resettles his glasses. Folding his arms on top of the wheel and resting his chin on them, he stared beyond the reach of the lamp.</p><p>There is something more pressing than the whereabouts of Charlie right now—something they have been avoiding to discuss. Charlie is as good as gone, and William forces himself to accept that. This creates a new reason with which their parents can use to pressure them about having kids. There is no excuse for him and Lindsay to avoid the talk anymore. Should they have one, when should they have one, how to face the pressure. He knows that he can't be a good parent, lacking one himself. If they had a kid, what if he becomes that father they encountered earlier, and the kid that daughter? Even if they don't, will he be any better than him, or any one of his parents? Maybe he'll try to do what his grandmother did for him, cooking and asking about the day… but he never gave her any trouble. If his child does, will he resort to verbal and physical violence? It's his greatest fear, and he is not certain that he won't. He does wonder, as an amusing thought, whether their kid will also be a telepath…</p><p>Maybe he should go find her. He wants to hear what Lindsay has to say. No. He wants to <em>feel</em> it. Whenever she looks moody or in pain, he wants to share whatever she's feeling, and bear it with her. He wonders whether ordinary people have this constant need to feel and to understand. How do they deal with it? Perhaps they don't, and are content with the negativity. Or perhaps they do, and yearn for telepathy.</p><p>Maybe it's just the Law of the World that two people can never know each other well, not even telepaths, and such is one of those mundane contradictions. The girl who hates spinach and the boy who loves it, the healthy beggar and the ill office clerk, the two people who can perceive everyone else's thoughts except each other's—all of these contradictory units form the world. Perhaps the mirror metaphor itself is one of these contradictions, that the mirrors are in essence the same: when facing each other they see each other, and themselves, over and over again, stretching way deep into each other.</p><p><em>Should I take comfort in that?</em> The image of Lindsay curled up, trembling and gasping in pain and eyes wide with fear, burns in his mind eye. <em>Perhaps what we feel might not be so different? Still, the next time she feels pain, I want to know. I want to share the burden.</em> Outside, a snowflake, big as a feather, lands and shrinks on the windshield, followed by another and another. His stomach growls. <em>We're eating out tonight, I guess. Come back soon.</em></p><center>**</center><p>Black branches crisscross above like spokes of wheels. No moon. No stars. Nothing. Maybe a few minds of elks? No dogs. Not even wolves. Lindsay realizes her hair is undone at some point near the hospital. <em>Doesn't matter. My neck'll be warmer.</em> She thinks.</p><p>Each of her uneven steps get stronger than the last, but her head still throbs. Small tremors crawl through her skin. The pain between her legs is a little tough to ignore. So these, all of these, she will <em>love</em> it? Her mother has been suggesting to her ever since Mikaela had her baby. "Look at him," she cooed at her grandson during their last video chat. "Say hi to auntie! Lindsay, you'll know when you have yours. You'll <em>love</em> it." Had this been in person, she might understand her mother better. But through a screen, she could only frown.</p><p>She emerges from the trees, twenty or so meters from her is the shore of a lake. She can hardly see the water. It's cold but windless. Lindsay slides down to the foot of the closest tree, and squeezes her legs together. <em>It still hurts.</em> Funny her father never nagged her about children. <em>Could it be guilt? After some years he finally knew what he put mom through three times? Or that he realized three was too many?</em> How horrible, to be ripped open like that. The blood, the pain… The worst thing was that there was no one with whom to share. Does she want him to feel it? How? By having William stab himself with a knife when she's in labor? By those stupid devices they use to let the fathers have a taste of a tenth of the pain the mothers are feeling? By her telepathy?</p><p>Her telepathy, either the mundane contradiction or the divine irony that tops the rest—is it a blessing or a curse? She can't understand how a trait that can set two people so far apart even exist. When William is going through whatever he was going through back with that family, she could do nothing but watch. Her touch had no effect neither on his pain nor her attempts at telepathy. He says he'll tell her, but what will be omitted through words? One can struggle to find the right words yet still get not a fraction of her meaning across. Perhaps no one in the world can understand another person as thoroughly as understanding oneself. <em>Or perhaps we aren't so different—I couldn't share his pain entirely, nor can he mine back at the hospital. Small comfort in negativity.</em> William's face blooms into her mind. <em>I'd like to know how you managed to joke and kept on driving after that, though. You always do, masking annoyance after your dad calls or sadness after your mom messages with a poker face. Don't hide from me, please, and I'll promise that I won't hide myself from now on.</em></p><p>Lindsay feels the pain finally subsides. She raises and steps just to the edge of the lake. She can see nothing other than a faint outline stretching from before her feet to her left and right, and the mist blurs even that. She calls for Charlie in her mind, and then again out loud. Nothing. Her voice is lost fast around her, leaving not even an echo. <em>This is it.</em> She looks ahead. <em>The excuse they need. "You'll probably lose the next dog, too, so better hurry up and have a real child that you sure will look after better."</em></p><p>They can't avoid the subject any longer. Charlie is gone. When their parents learn of it they'll pounce on it, especially William's father. <em>That man… he has some ideology issues about genders. Is he really a biologist?</em> She needs to talk to William—what do they want, when do they want it, how to deal with the pressure. <em>I also want to know his reasons for avoiding this. I'll tell him mine.</em> Looking down, she imagines the black water reflecting faces of William's father, her mother, and Mrs. Olsen. "This is our own business. You stay—" Ignoring a pang of hunger, she stomps into the water. "—out of it!"</p><p>She backs off and watch flakes of snow, large as feathers, starting to join the water in ripples.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Lao Wang woke to an infant dawn hiding behind the curtains. Light snuck its way onto his wrinkled face through the gap, which he turned to his decade-old alarm clock first, then to the curtains, and finally to the metal heater at the foot of his bed. Dressing took him less than ten minutes: after his wife passed away almost two years ago, he had kept his clothes on the empty side of the bed instead of on the heater—a mere substitute of what was lost, even if it meant for him starting his winter days cold.</p><p>For the past two weeks, Lao Wang has broken out of his morning routine of curtains, bathroom, wash, and breakfast. He went straight to the foot of his bed, and squatted down to stroke Coco, his Chinese rural dog. The mud-yellow fur was stiff and the body was lukewarm. She slept on her side in the many-layered nest, breathing way too shallow for Lao Wang&#39;s liking. Coco hadn&#39;t moved much for two weeks and Lao Wang felt that it would be any day now. He went to pour milk into one of her bowls and filled up the other with chow.</p><a id="more"></a><p>&quot;Stay with me, Coco.&quot; He murmured, stroking her head. &quot;Stay with me.&quot;</p><p>In the bathroom, the sensors on the toilet directed the seat to warm up to forty degrees Celsius fifteen seconds before Lao Wang entered, and the light went on ten seconds after the seats. As usual, when he turned to flush, Lao Wang instead found himself frowning at a screen displaying analysis of his contents. The lid was already closing and the toilet flushed itself. The mirror tried to tell Lao Wang the temperature of the day, along with humidity, air pressure, UV index, and air quality. &quot;Go away, damn it.&quot; Lao Wang muttered. His son, Xiao Wang, would have added a news module to it had he not threw a fit: &quot;As if I need to waste more time in the bathroom!&quot;</p><p>Lao Wang looked at his reflection. It was a face he recognized but didn&#39;t fully identify with. Wrinkled, thin face, white hairs and high hair lines, dim eyes made bigger by his frame shrunken by age. A few dark spots here and there; thankfully, no hairy warts. He couldn&#39;t believe he was seventy-three. Seventy-three—old age had never been something that bothered him much in his youth. He was a programmer by trade, and whiled away most of his days beside a computer and a keyboard. Before his fortieth birthday, Lao Wang decided that his whole life would be coding and his offspring would only be his programs. He took pride in his one-line codes in java and the first cries of &quot;Hello World&quot; from his programs and apps. He thought he&#39;d grow old only when his programs stop producing bugs. But, Lao Wang reflected as he turned on the gas stove (the AI somewhere in the kitchen turned on the exhaust), before he knew it, he got married.</p><p>&quot;Must be the weather.&quot; Lao Wang muttered, shaking away the dark thoughts. He swallowed a spoonful of porridge. Artsy and sentimental were never among words that people used to describe him. Today, Lao Wang couldn&#39;t help but feel that way. &quot;Must be old age.&quot; He muttered after another spoonful.</p><p>Dawn was now trying to push aside the curtain. In the muffled light, Lao Wang finished his breakfast and went to crouch down beside his dog.</p><p>&quot;Coco, Coco.&quot; He called.</p><p>The old dog was still.</p><p>&quot;Wake up, will you?&quot;</p><p><em>Oh dear</em>. He thought. He stroked her again. The warmth that was there was evaporating.</p><p>&quot;Wake up, old girl.&quot; He never thought he could sound so desperate and useless. &quot;Coco?&quot; He remembered how unambiguous his wife had died—there was no mistaking the straight line on the cardiograph and the limp hand sliding out of his grasp. &quot;Coco?&quot;</p><p>The automatic curtains chose this moment to move. Thick brown fabrics glided silently aside in their electromagnetic grooves and light squeezed into every room of Lao Wang&#39;s apartment that it can reach. The magnificence spread over Coco&#39;s body and drowned Lao Wang.</p><p>The old man was no longer crouching. He slumped against the wall in the pool of light, one hand still on his dog&#39;s head.</p><center> ** </center><p>&quot;Dad?&quot; Xiao Wang&#39;s voice soothed Lao Wang a little through the phone. Xiao Wang worked in a prominent state-owned technology company. Most of his time was spent on either coding or fiddling around cutting-edge technology. Lao Wang could understand his talks of virtual reality and augmented reality at first. Later ones about artificial intelligence training, organism memory-digital data transcoding, and even inventions of new programming languages were beyond him. It had always been his wife calling their son, and Lao Wang preferred chatting face-to-face. Later he had picked the habit up after her passing, but on a lower frequency. Sometimes he checked on Xiao Wang&#39;s life, but at other times, he just wanted to talk. &quot;Dad? What&#39;s up?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, not much. Just wanted to check on you.&quot; Lao Wang replied.</p><p>&quot;I’m not bad—my department is finalizing the last syntaxes for this language we&#39;re inventing. Remember, dad? The one that we dubbed &#39;Byron&#39;? Now, we&#39;ve managed to make it four times more versatile…&quot;</p><p>Lao Wang let him speak, understanding little, at best. <em>Better hear about the boy&#39;s jargons than thinking about Coco</em>, he thought. He &quot;oh&quot;ed and &quot;ah&quot;ed where he could.</p><p>&quot;…and guess what we call he test program? C&#39;mon dad, take a guess.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What, not &#39;Hello World&#39; anymore?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Much better: &#39;Hello, Mad Psychotic World&#39;! Haha!&quot; Xiao Wang seemed to have dropped the phone in excitement. &quot;I wish you could see it, dad—didn&#39;t I tell you about the program, ARt?&quot; —Lao Wang remembered that during one rare visit from his son last month, he showed him a communication program that can project a person&#39;s surroundings to his interlocutor— &quot;We should use it right now, so you can see the test program!&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, I&#39;m sure you can show me the next time you visit.&quot; Lao Wang wondered if he should tell Xiao Wang about Coco soon.</p><p>&quot;Oh… sure!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Coco died, you see.&quot; It was some time before Lao Wang spoke again. &quot;This morning, or maybe over the night.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What? Dead? I&#39;m sorry, dad.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Can you come over after work today? Or over the weekend?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Um, that&#39;s one thing I couldn&#39;t do, you see… as I said, we&#39;re finishing up the project… it&#39;s near the end of the year, too, the progress is looking good, and I happened to be the lead program engineer, so, uh…&quot; His son&#39;s genuine apologetic tone sounded lame to Lao Wang. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, dad.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Alright then.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hey, let me make up for that, alright, dad? The AI department here had a breakthrough. See, they managed to replicate a dog&#39;s conscious with their program.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Wouldn&#39;t I just buy a new, organic dog if I need one?&quot; Lao Wang mumbled. &quot;Are you trying to find them a beta tester?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh? You&#39;ll be the first <em>owner</em>! <em>I</em> was one of the beta testers. It&#39;ll be fine—they&#39;ve even hooked up with the robotics department and made its vector look and work like a real dog. It&#39;s brilliant. I can ask them to make it look like Coco, and send it over. It&#39;ll be fast, since we&#39;re in the same city.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Fine.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sorry that I couldn&#39;t make it, dad. Uh… consider the dog me in the meantime.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m not sure I want to think that way, you know? Having a dog for a son?&quot;</p><p>&quot;There&#39;s always Lunar New Year. I <em>always</em> come home for Lunar New Year.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Right.&quot; <em>Probably the only time other than my birthday you are guaranteed to come.</em> Lao Wang thought. &quot;Well, get back to work, you; don&#39;t let me keep you.&quot;</p><p>Lao Wang wasn&#39;t the type of parent who used himself as examples for his children, but he couldn&#39;t help remembering the times when he was young. He had always tried to find time to visit <em>his</em> parents, even on the nights around November 11^th, when &quot;Double Eleven&quot;-shoppers bombarded the servers he was taking care of. He had never been a lead programmer though, so he couldn&#39;t talk about being busy.</p><p>The sofa next to the phone faced a TV, and above it hang the wedding photo of Lao Wang and his wife thirty-three years ago. It was this that he rested his eyes on. The color was still vibrant behind the glass pane. His younger self stood in a full black suit, sporting a smart haircut and an embarrassed smile. His hooked nose and square jaw were highlighted by the sun. He looked much younger than forty. He was resting his forehead on hers. His wife&#39;s hair was tied up into a high bun, following the customs of the day. Long strands curled down the sides of her thin and smooth face, down to her pointed chin. Her usually big eyes were squinting with laughter. Her wedding dress matched the white seagulls in the background. It was a late spring day.</p><p>Lao Wang allowed himself indulge in the photo for another second, and called up his friend, Lao Chen, to borrow a shovel for Coco&#39;s burial.</p><center> ** </center><p>It was an unremarkable grave. Lao Wang picked the spot only because it was within view of his balcony: that fir tree on the side of the hill behind his home. The hill was part of a park, so Lao Wang went well off-road for the grave.</p><p>&quot;Look, you can see your balcony from here, but you can&#39;t pick out here from your balcony. This tree is the only thing you can see.&quot; Lao Chen said. He was an ex-fellow co-programmer living in the building next to Lao Wang. &quot;I was hoping for a better reason, even if it&#39;s &#39;good <em>FengShui</em>&#39;.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s <em>my</em> dog we&#39;re burying here, Lao Chen. You can bury yours wherever you want next time.&quot;</p><p>It was the third day of the burial. The soil on the grave was still black and a little wet. The day was rather pleasant: warm for December, and clear. A group of old women climbed the steps well away, but their voice pierced through trees, singing old songs from Lady Gaga. It stopped when one of them shrieked,</p><p>&quot;Hey look! Is that a delivery drone?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Why, it is!&quot; yelled another.</p><p>&quot;Are they finally deploying them for commercial uses? After 50 years?&quot; shouted yet another.</p><p>&quot;Whoever gets that is lucky, no doubt.&quot; said the first one.</p><p>&quot;Lucky, my hat.&quot; Lao Chen nudged Lao Wang. &quot;The recipient just lost his dog. It&#39;s going toward your balcony, Lao Wang!&quot;</p><p>Sure enough, Lao Wang saw a drone carrying an oblong box making a beeline at his balcony. No one in their right mind would use a drone for delivery, unless they were rich and tech-savvy. He knew what was in there.</p><center> ** </center><p>It wasn&#39;t that the robot dog didn&#39;t look like the real Coco; what bothered Lao Wang was the fact that it was a _robot_—one with cutting-edge technology inside its head, another symbol of the fast-changing world that his son had more or less forced into his life, while keeping himself out of it.</p><p>It was two days after the robot&#39;s arrival. Lao Chen came to visit again.</p><p>&quot;Damn dog your son got you here. It&#39;s a perfect replica.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Only in looks it&#39;s perfect.&quot; Lao Wang said, watching Lao Chen playing with it. Indeed it was so. The robot came with the same mud-yellow coat as the original, with the same dark, glassy eyes and a long snout. It even had the white patch of furs on its lower jaw.</p><p>Lao Chen flipped it over and rubbed its belly. It squinted its eyes and wagged out its tongue. He tutted.</p><p>&quot;Damn good make here, Lao Wang. Look at those teeth they made. You sure you weren&#39;t fooling me about Coco being dead?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Your tongue runs on as ever,&quot; came the stiff reply. Lao Wang sat crouching on the sofa, elbows on thighs and eyebrows on top of each other.</p><p>&quot;What&#39;s up? Your son&#39;s an accomplished man, and you&#39;re benefiting as his dad. I&#39;d be twice as happy if my two kids brought home half as many high-tech gadgets your son did, even if they don&#39;t have a hand in the program codes.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You can take the mirror, toilet, stove, and curtains home anytime.&quot; Lao Wang growled. The robot dog rolled out from under Lao Chen&#39;s hands and padded over, poking its snout into Lao Wang&#39;s hands. It was Coco&#39;s signature move. Lao Wang didn&#39;t respond, but wondered instinctively how the AI learnt so much in so short a time: had his son been training it all along, preparing for this day? How did his son log in all of his habits, then? Lao Wang looked around in alarm.</p><p>&quot;Wha-? Lao Wang, what are you doing?&quot; Lao Chen stood up, and then sat down on the sofa as a momentary dizziness hit him. When the black spots faded, he saw his friend taking apart the wedding photo&#39;s frame. Then he watched him taking apart the clock on the wall, banging at the heater pipes, and pulling out cushions on the sofas. The robot dog bounded in excitement after him. Lao Chen decided to stop his home-demolition when Lao Wang tried to climb onto the wide windowsill. &quot;Damn, old man, what are you doing?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Help me pull down that curtain! I need to look at the rod.&quot;</p><p>&quot;For what?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hidden cameras!&quot;</p><p>&quot;What&#39;s gotten into you, man?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s too fast for an AI to learn Coco&#39;s behaviors in less than four days, when it took AlphaGo <em>months</em> to beat the world champion?&quot;</p><p>The two old men stared at each other.</p><p>&quot;That was four decades ago.&quot; Lao Chen said blankly.</p><p>They stared at each other some more.</p><p>&quot;Get down here!&quot; Lao Chen barked. Lao Wang slowly complied. &quot;Why would you think your own son needed to surveil you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;How did this AI learn so fast, then? From where?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Your son&#39;s own memory? Weren&#39;t you complaining about some memory-reader he was working on some months ago?&quot; Lao Chen saw the other scowl at the floor, a hand scratching the robot&#39;s head. &quot;So what are you calling it?&quot; He jutted his chin at the robot. Lao Wang&#39;s hand snapped back.</p><p>&quot;Nothing.&quot; He mumbled.</p><p>&quot;Why not just &#39;Coco&#39;?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don&#39;t feel like it.&quot;</p><p>They sat in silence for a moment until Lao Chen couldn&#39;t stand it anymore.</p><p>&quot;Ah-aye! Forget about it all. Get out your chess board. Let&#39;s play chess. Play chess!&quot; He waved his hand, irritated.</p><center> ** </center><p>Lao Wang saw his friend off in better spirits despite losing 2-4. He decided to take the dog (<em>—robot—</em>) out for a walk. The mirror reminded him his face mask in this weather, and he leashed up the robot. Lao Wang hadn&#39;t done that for the original Coco for years, but he felt obligated for the robot.</p><p>The grey smog wasn&#39;t too horrible. A northwest wind was blowing, and Lao Wang knew it meant more smog was on the way. He walked with the dog in tow, passing tall apartments. The sidewalk was splattered with dirty marks despite the street sweepers and their robots.</p><p>&quot;You know,&quot; he peered at the robot dog, who looked up as Coco would do, &quot;ten years ago they installed robots to replace the street sweepers. Real bulks of metal, those robots, nothing like you or the ones over there.&quot; He indicated those white hovering boxes with arms attached. &quot;They had hoped to cut down labor cost. Turned out the cost saved was poured back into robotic maintenance—hey, stop it!&quot; The robot dog was snigging at random tree trunks and pole bases, and was now crouching down to pee. &quot;I thought only male dogs have territorial behaviors? Something wrong with your AI?&quot;</p><p>A few passersby glanced at him with sympathy. Lao Wang ignored them and tugged at the leash.</p><p>&quot;As I was saying, the government spent millions in maintenance and rehabilitation of the laid-off sweepers. Later they spent yet more on replacing stolen robots. Can you believe people steal robot sweepers, dog? To sell the metal and modules for money?&quot;</p><p>The robot looked back, tongue out, as though smiling. Lao Wang turned to look at the buildings instead. These towering apartments looked just like the one he lived in, painted one yellow vertical stripes between two grey ones. Every window was encased in a stainless steel, anti-burglar cages.</p><p>&quot;Look at them, dog. Those cages has been around for more than fifty years and people started to un-see them. Visual fatigue. Know why we don&#39;t have them around our window, dog?&quot; Lao Wang lowered his head and voice, &quot;Because <em>we</em> got anti-burglar defense that zaps!&quot; He straightened up again. &quot;They don&#39;t have a son who sends all sorts of high-tech things except himself to them, either.&quot;</p><p>The park looked desolate. A red cloth banner saying &quot;Increase sports activities / Enhance people&#39;s health&quot; flapped frail in the wind. A few people were out at the stone tables playing chess or cards. They called out to Lao Wang.</p><p>&quot;Your dog looks livelier today, Lao Wang.&quot; One remarked.</p><p>&quot;Yes, yes. Terminal Lucidity, I&#39;m afraid.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Didn&#39;t you bury something the other day?&quot; Another asked.</p><p>&quot;That was somebody else&#39;s.&quot;</p><p>&quot;How&#39;s your son? Working hard as usual?&quot; chimed in yet another.</p><p>&quot;As usual.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Come on over for a match.&quot; Said the first one again.</p><p>&quot;Another time.&quot;</p><p>They waved Lao Wang goodbyes and left him on his way.</p><p>The only appliance of his intelligent stove that Lao Wang liked and used was the fanless exhaust. It adjusted the intake according to the environment in a snap. Lao Wang and his wife hated a fumy kitchen, and the place being long and narrow didn&#39;t help.</p><p>Lao Wang stood there dicing meat. He recalled when his wife was still alive. They always cooked together. The kitchen was crowded with two people already, and sometimes more so with their son and later Coco barging in because of the smell. They didn&#39;t talk too much during cooking, but Lao Wang felt that the sound of knives against the cutting board and the two of them cooperating flawlessly were good enough. It made the narrow kitchen cozy.</p><p>The robot Coco came into the kitchen, wagging its tail. It laid two paws onto the counter.</p><p>&quot;Get off. I&#39;ll feed you later.&quot; Lao Wang waved at it.</p><p>The kitchen was way too empty now. He wondered if things would be better if Xiao Wang was back living with him. The youth didn&#39;t have any dates yet, after all. Besides, they had good times cooking together when Xiao Wang was still in college. They could still chat now, even though Lao Wang couldn&#39;t understand half of what he said…</p><p>&quot;Get away from the microwave, there. It&#39;s bad for your health—I mean, your circuits.&quot; Lao Wang called out to the robot. &quot;Come here, dog—I mean—&quot; How do you address it, really? He thought furiously and held the robot up. It was warm and soft like the real thing. Lao Wang stuffed a piece of meat into its jaws and sent it on its way out. Its internal mechanisms would take care of the meat and its energy. He was reluctant to name it at all. Robotic dogs were to him always white polygons whose nose fires up when they &quot;bark&quot;. This one he had was too real; yet he couldn&#39;t look past the knowledge of its robotic origin.</p><center> ** </center><p>The thing that Lao Wang was reluctant to admit: he got used to the robot Coco. It took only a week for him to return to his &quot;curtains-bathroom-wash-breakfast&quot; morning routine.</p><p>The thing that Lao Wang was quick to admit but reluctant to praise: the robot Coco was, in quite a literal sense, artificially intelligent. He had never trained the original Coco systematically; whatever manners and help she had or had given were results of year-long learning and hundreds of &quot;no&quot;s and &quot;don&#39;t&quot;s. Lao Wang didn&#39;t know what type of memories his son had used to train the robot dog, but he was sure that, when it first arrived, it couldn&#39;t and didn&#39;t pad over, late at night, to nuzzle him about bedtime when he was engrossed in parsing out the latest tech report; nor did it knew what he was looking for when he misplaced his glasses in the first two days. Lao Wang knew that AI could learn and improve, but it couldn&#39;t &quot;forget&quot; and then &quot;remember&quot;, so to speak. There was no way to make some pre-learnt function dormant, ignoring all the stimulants, and then trigger until time was ripe. In a word, the robot dog was learning manners and behaviors on-the-go. It amazed Lao Wang by how much it surpassed the original in two mere weeks.</p><p>The thing that Lao Wang was uncomfortable about: the robot dog seemed almost human.</p><p>During their walks, Lao Wang passed Coco&#39;s grave often. The dirt was no longer black or fresh, and vegetative debris were starting to cover it. For the first few times, Lao Wang just stood there, lost in thought beside the fir tree. The robot dog wandered about. On later visits, when he pulled himself out of reverie, he found the robot at times standing there in mid-wander, observing him, carrying on only after it saw him move, as if affirming his living state. At last, one day, Lao Wang found it sitting next to his feet, looking up as if in question.</p><p>&quot;Here lies your predecessor, Coco.&quot; was all he said.</p><p>The robot gave the patch a wistful look, and back at Lao Wang. It was a windy and frostbitten mid-December day, and Lao Wang couldn&#39;t stand the slicing wind now that he took notice of it. He pulled up his scarf and turned to go, but the robot dog went and laid down over the grave. Lao Wang thought he noticed a bug in the programming here: a real dog wouldn&#39;t have done that in the cold, even if they had heavy coats to cushion the underbelly. But why did it do that? Had it understood and strung together words of &quot;lies&quot;, &quot;predecessor&quot;, and &quot;Coco&quot;? Did it understood that this was a grave of significance? The robot gave a sudden bark, and Lao Wang looked around in alarm. Nothing was there. It gave a few more barks and a long howl, and he realized that it was mourning. The robot dog had never barked before, not even when other, real dogs harassed it. Its first cries were for mourning. Lao Wang then remembered further that, on one of the visits to his mother&#39;s grave, his son was equally silent, kneeling before the grave. It was a full five minutes before Xiao Wang cried out &quot;Mom! Mom!&quot; and started wailing.</p><p>Lao Wang wasn&#39;t sure how to feel.</p><center> ** </center><p>&quot;That might be a memory leak, so to speak.&quot; Xiao Wang said over the phone. &quot;When we taught it concepts of &#39;mourning&#39; and &#39;death&#39;, they collected memory data from volunteers all over the company, and some of my own latent memories might have leaked in the process. Those are the hardest to shut out, especially powerful and recent ones. So, yeah, I guess there is a bit of me in there. Gotta report this to the dev team. Anyways, I&#39;m quite happy to hear that it learnt to express emotions through barking.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You never thought to teach a dog AI bark?&quot; Lao Wang laughed.</p><p>&quot;They did, but I asked them not to implement it in yours, since I figured you like a quiet dog. Did it pick it up from other dogs?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. They knew right away the robot Coco wasn&#39;t a real dog.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It never barked back at them?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, and it remains a quiet dog, even now.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Fascinating… Hey dad?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hmm?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Mind if I extract user data from robot Coco for research purposes? I&#39;m interested in that rule-learning behavior, and I&#39;m sure the dev team for the Anitek—that the AI system—would learn something from it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I thought I&#39;m not a beta tester?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Come on, dad, even operating systems collect user data for improvements in their public stable versions!&quot;</p><p>&quot;There&#39;s no way I&#39;m handing over my data, not when that robot has unlimited access to my private life. What else is in there? Photo-wireless modules that transfer data through light?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It doesn&#39;t have any wireless modules, dad, you know that. We use specialized probes to physically extract data; it&#39;s like paying a visit to a vet. Besides, your mirrors, toilets, and stoves have access to your life, too.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don&#39;t spend my entire life before them. Besides, I&#39;ve hacked their wireless chips the moment I got them. They can only upload packets pre-configured by me. So no, let&#39;s drop this discussion about user data. I&#39;m not handing it over.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&#39;s my dad, I guess.&quot; Xiao Wang sounded both happy and irritated. &quot;I&#39;m glad at least that you&#39;re getting along well with the dog, and that it reminds you of both Coco and me. It&#39;s like having us around, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;d prefer the originals.&quot; Lao Wang grunted.</p><p>&quot;Cheer up, dad. It&#39;s Winter Solstice tomorrow, and I&#39;m getting off early. I&#39;m coming over.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Seriously?&quot; Lao Wang sat up straight. &quot;Your Uncle Chen and Aunt Li will be sending over dumplings as usual. Can you really make it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, I think so.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&#39;ll be great, son. I look forward to it.&quot;</p><center> ** </center><p>Lao Wang&#39;s phone rang again the next morning.</p><p>&quot;Dad,&quot; came Xiao Wang&#39;s sullen and frustrated voice. &quot;I&#39;m sorry. I can&#39;t visit today. The testing team found a major bug in our &#39;Hello, Mad Psychotic World&#39; program. It has to do with a syntax conflict in our Byron language. Leaves a backdoor in the program…&quot;</p><p>&quot;Privacy concern, huh?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ironic, I know. Sorry to blow it, dad…&quot;</p><p>&quot;Alright then.&quot;</p><p>No sooner than he hang up did the doorbell ring. The only intelligent appliance generalized in every household was the intelligent doorbell, which recognized faces in addition to projecting outside environment on a screen inside. Lao Wang didn&#39;t need these to know it was Lao Chen and his wife Lao Li.</p><p>&quot;Winter Solstice dumpling delivery!&quot; Lao Chen was in his usual high spirits when they came in. &quot;Gave you some eighty in here, forty pork and cabbage filling, and forty shrimp filling. They&#39;re big, and can last you a while—&quot; But his wife noticed Lao Wang&#39;s glum look.</p><p>&quot;What&#39;s wrong, Lao Wang?&quot; She asked. He replied it was nothing, but she was known for her shrewdness. &quot;Your son not coming home today?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No. He just called about it. Some bug in the program he got.&quot; Lao Wang answered after some hesitation.</p><p>&quot;Come to our place tonight, then.&quot; Lao Chen said, &quot;Like last year. Our kids aren&#39;t coming back, either.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Nah, I&#39;ll be fine. Thanks for the dumpling here.&quot;</p><p>They left after chatting a little, and Lao Wang turned to the robot Coco.</p><p>&quot;Hear that?&quot; He said. &quot;&#39;Like last year&#39;? Xiao Wang don&#39;t come home that often, you know?&quot; The wedding photo caught his eye. What a contrast between the sunny weather inside and the bleak grey outside. &quot;Say, you want to walk?&quot;</p><p>Lao Wang didn&#39;t get out until after lunch. To speed things up, he used the automatic dishwasher for the first time, and didn&#39;t leave until he was sure the thing wouldn&#39;t break his plates.</p><p>&quot;Let&#39;s go for a long one.&quot; He said to the dog once they stood under the grey clouds and he had leashed up the dog&#39;s mouth. They waited at the bus stop, which consisted of a digital pane showing bus schedules and an overhead hood.</p><p>It was cold, and few were out and about. The bus, white with blue stripes, came gliding into the station. The entire public transport system was updated to self-driving vehicles a decade ago, and AIs were integrated to handle driving, ticketing, and securities. Many opposed this upgrade at first, citing concerns of danger-perception and hacking. The voices ceased after a few vocal ones from the opposite side reminded everyone that self-driving cars has been commercially available for thirty year by then, and the country was lagging behind the international standards for public transportation. There was a human guard on every bus in the beginning, but gradually they were cut, too. Lao Wang often marveled at the rate of technology evolution, but, at the same time, found some aspects of it puzzling. Why did the change in public transport went so well but not that of the street sweepers? Why did various levels of AI were so generalized in public services but not homes? For the former, he had no clue. For the latter, he believed it was because there were too many people like him around, who prefer the older ways.</p><p>Lao Wang stepped into the bus, a leash in one hand and a plastic bag of cooked dumplings in a bowl in the other. The ticketing system scanned his fingerprint and beeped.</p><p>&quot;Free ride for seniors over 65. Please take care of your dog. Have a safe trip.&quot;</p><p>The bus ran on electricity, and passed smoothly from the residential area to outskirts of the city. Bigger, flatter, and shinier designer buildings replaced tall apartments, and Lao Wang found himself with his two things in front of a technological facility park. On the left of its metal folding gate lay a slab of marble carved with characters, &quot;State Technology Research and Development Industrial Park, Lyuchuan Branch&quot;. On the right was a gatehouse. The door guard weren&#39;t too happy to make an inline call.</p><p>&quot;R-D Department 6? Someone&#39;s here for Wang Jian.&quot; He pressed a button on the communication screen and called.</p><p>A young woman&#39;s face showed up.</p><p>&quot;Department 6 reception desk. Engineer Wang isn&#39;t available right now. Do you want to wait?&quot; Then she saw Lao Wang&#39;s face. &quot;Oh, are you a relative? Do you want to come in and wait here instead?&quot;</p><p><em>Such were the power of genes</em>, Lao Wang thought. He came out of the other side of the gatehouse and walked on.</p><p>Most of the trees in the empty facility park were bare save for a few fir and pine. In the summer, the place would be blooming with flowers. Lao Wang saw a janitor robot gliding nearby, its arms hovering at, instead of attached to, its side. A group of people stood a little way off, tablets in hand. A banner stretched across the walls of one of the white buildings, yellow characters of &quot;Science is the primary force of productivity&quot; fading against a red background. The park was almost silent save for the wind. The robot dog strode obediently in its leash, tail wagging and hitting Lao Wang&#39;s leg while the bag of dumplings swayed and did the same.</p><p>The reception girl for Department 6 poured him a cup of hot tea and made small talks, smiling as she did.</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m really sorry. Engineer Wang went down to the lab just minutes before you called.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I can wait here for some time. I got him dumplings.&quot; Lao Wang looked around the wide and bright reception area, and made himself comfortable.</p><p>To be honest, Lao Wang didn&#39;t know himself why he decided to come. He could have just gone to Lao Chen&#39;s for dinner. Perhaps he missed his son. Perhaps it was better to be active than passive in this matter; if Xiao Wang didn&#39;t have time to visit him, he could find time to visit Xiao Wang.</p><p>He wondered what could happen when they meet. Maybe he&#39;d simply hand over the dumplings and be on his way. Would Xiao Wang get angry that his dad intruded into his work place? Lao Wang recalled the phone call yesterday, the part concerning robot Coco&#39;s user data. Maybe Xiao Wang might think that he had changed his mind on that matter and were handing it over, after all, and overlook the dumplings, being the workaholic he was. <em>Then I&#39;ll make him choose</em>, Lao Wang thought, <em>either work or family, the dog or the dumplings</em>.</p><p>The digital clock on the wall flitted away the seconds.</p><p>Lao Wang felt stubborn, like a &quot;proper old man&quot;. He was sure he has changed after his wife died. He was becoming more and more stubborn and paranoid, especially about technology. He was not the all-embracing programmer he once was, proud of his java codes. Intelligent mirror, toilets, stove, curtains? Who needed them, really? People got by well before them.</p><p>One thing Lao Wang knew he didn&#39;t change was his need and the weight he put on relationships. He had always paid weekly visits to his parents, and later, to his wife&#39;s. He still kept in touch with the friends he had, before they died. Lao Chen was his son&#39;s godfather. In his thirty years of marriage, he couldn&#39;t deny there were fights, but he tried hard to make up for them the next day. Those fights got fewer and fewer as time went on. &quot;Technology connects people&quot;, so goes some old proverb back in the days. Lao Wang had always scoffed at that. Long-distance communications were planned and scheduled, in his view, and therefore they were artificial. Face-to-face interactions were spontaneous and natural. He had studied overseas before, and sometimes, his friends and parents wouldn&#39;t reply until hours later, due to time differences or schedule conflicts. Whatever emotions that motivated him to send the message initially were long gone after he received the reply. Then he remembered the smart phones that evolved into a much smaller form. That didn&#39;t change: most of the people, even the old ones, have their eyes glued to it everywhere until their eyes fail. Only then did technology connect people, much too late, in Lao Wang&#39;s opinion.</p><p>Lao Wang was lonely. An old bird in the cold wired nest he once wrought for himself, which his son built upon later. He spent most of his life to technology, and in the end—Lao Wang smirked at the floor—he felt himself forsaken and kicked out by it, and came to despise it.</p><p>The clock on the wall showed that he had stayed for half an hour, and there was still no sign of his son. He took his leave.</p><p>Outside the facility, the grey sky was starting to clear up. Lao Wang could see a patch of musky yellow lingering around the horizon. It was a tradition to eat dumplings on the shortest day of the year, but what was it eating alone?</p><p>A white mist puffed around Lao Wang&#39;s and his dog&#39;s mouths. The dumplings were already frozen in the wind.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>　　“别担心啦，我在另一头等你。”比利安慰道。“他们说什么你做什么就行，问什么就答什么。大多数情况下他们也就看一下你的护照和签证，然后也就没别的了。”</p><p>　　“他们能听懂我说的话吗？”艾瑞思四下看了看。海关大厅里挤满了人。大厅宽大明亮，人山人海。防护带把大厅一分为二，一边挤满了人，另一边被更多防护带围成了迷宫，两条队伍在里面缓布前行，围着一根柱子绕了一圈又一圈。柱子上的电视屏幕播放着一遍又一遍“准备好您的护照”和“如果您有需要申报的物品”之类的话。</p><a id="more"></a><p>　　人群中大多数是中国人，黑头发、黑眼睛和或深或浅黄皮肤，和她一样。皮肤黑一些的看上去不是特别文雅（倒也不是不文明——只是他们的在田里的干农活的双手又大又粗糙满是老茧），而肤色浅一些的人里面，有的看上去像是从小在蜜罐里长大一样，有的却普通的不能再普通（有的学生戴着细框眼镜、背着又大又重的书包，有的穿着抢眼的衣服、胳膊上挂着一个包，脸上的妆竟然奇迹般地没有花）。他们当中也有外国人，虽然占着更大的地方，但是更安静一些（倒也不是一言不发）。艾瑞思听见一个胖妇人叫她的孩子闭上嘴、赶紧走。几个学生模样的外国人睁着大眼睛，梦游一般，不是很确定该往哪里走。整个大厅里只有穿着绿色或蓝色制服的海关和机场工作人员比较镇静，维持着秩序、引导着人流。</p><p>　　“嗯，没问题。他们听的懂英语。”他取下脖子上的挂坠。“喏，拿着。这玩意儿能把你说的话翻译成你想让它翻译的语言。用之前碰它一下，然后想着你想让它翻译成什么就行了——哎呀，放松啦！”他看着艾瑞思不是很确定的样子笑了。“我在另一边等你！说不定我出来的比你早。”</p><p>　　她依旧有点紧张，点着头把挂坠塞进领子里。他轻轻地把她推向“外国来宾”的队伍入口。艾瑞思排到一个头戴耳机的学生后面。她回头张望，但比利已经消失在成群的羽绒服里。</p><p>　　她低头看着自己的护照。说实话，艾瑞思对这个蓝色的册子没有一丝好感，上面印着的鹰和烫金的“美利坚合众国”几个字对她来说一点意义都没有。<em>这又不是我的祖国，也不是我的世界，它也就是一个替代品……我的早没了……不过还是蛮有用的。</em>她想道。他们所属的学院肯定在政府里面有内线之类的人。几年前，当她为了逃避一些事情而离开岛的时候，罗比就让她等几天文件。所谓的“文件”结果是这本护照。她还以为学院会有自己单独的通往每个国家的通行证，但罗比（当时整个学院的领导人）摇了摇头，笑道，</p><p>　　“没，其实我也是到现在才知道。显然我们和所有人一样得用护照，不过我们组织在各自国家的政府里面都有联系人的……只是从来都没个人想起来跟我们说！简·斯格鲁斯夫人，也就是我和比利刚进学院的时候的领导人，直接忘了和麦吉说了！想想都很可笑，好不好，简从这里走了之后跑到政务会那儿去了，可她在那以后跟我们见面可不止一回两回的。”</p><p>　　“呵呵，想不到我的护照竟然还在。”比利面无表情地说。“不知道那帮精灵用啥。”</p><p>　　“他们有自己的船和魔法，哥们儿。”罗比答道。</p><p>　　如果她也有自己的小把戏就好了。艾瑞思在人群里一点也不舒服。也许是因为她在孤僻的地方住得太久了，或者是因为她以前的经历。纳伦之星并不是个游客景点，灯塔旁边的小镇子，克莱奥斯，也不是个什么大城市；在过去，对于她来说，人群就意味着死亡和屠杀。在这里，人人却盯着手机，是不是抬起头看看队伍排到哪儿了，脸色依然因为刚从航班上下来而显得苍白。有的人再试着打电话。她不知道如果比利也有手机的话会不会也这么做。她曾经问过比利，他是怎么说服他的父母同意把他送到学院里的，毕竟那里教的不是什么正常的东西——她到那里的第一天，比利和罗比开玩笑说这里教的是所谓的“剑和魔法”。他回答说他并不是送过去的，而是<em>人就在</em>那儿了。他的的航班坠机了，但让人匪夷所思的是，他活了下来是因为他的一个朋友把他们四个人（包括罗比）塞进了飞机上的厕所里——</p><p>　　“你确定？”艾瑞思不由自主地笑了。</p><p>　　“哦当然不了——我早死了。”比利翻了个白眼。</p><p>　　所以，当他在那以后第一次回家见爸妈的时候，比利已经在那里训练了两年。知道比利的脾气，艾瑞思总觉得这么晚回家见面是他故意的。他很少提起自己的家人，这也让她好奇他是怎么想起来要回家的。</p><p>　　艾瑞思前面的人走到了一个关口前，一个身着黑色制服的女士把她引向了另一个口。桌子后面的海关看了下她的签证（<em>谢了，政府里的关系，她心里怦怦跳</em>），然后带着唱歌一样的口音说：“在感应器上按下四个手指……再按另四个。好了。”</p><p>　　几分钟后，艾瑞思看到比利从关口里拖着又大又重的箱子出来，她呼出一口气，不禁笑了。</p><p>　　“哈哈，我先出来的！”</p><center>**</center><p>　　<em>诶，怎么就这样了……？</em>艾瑞思眼看着门被狠狠地摔上。</p><p>　　“白眼儿郎！”他的妈妈冲着门大吼。她的儿子刚从那里出去。“没礼貌的东西！有本事你他妈的别回来，你个婢养的熊崽子！”</p><p>　　“妈——妈！他是你自己养的儿子哎！”艾瑞思瞪大了眼睛。</p><p>　　“我他妈的没那样的个儿子！”</p><p>　　艾瑞思还从来没见过任何人那么生气。上一次比利发火的时候还是因为他提出的一个救援行动计划被毙了，当时好多人因此丧命。他听到消息时骂了足足五分钟，甚至在会议中也 没消气。所有人都在那个会议室里情绪低落，闷声不语，嘟囔着，“这个不该发生的”，而当时作为学院领导人的他情绪激动，五句话一砸桌子，把每一个被牵扯到的政务会的人都骂了个遍。那股怒火仿佛摇着小船流下溪流，要到了艾瑞思面前的这个人身上。她身材并不高大，弓着背，手指着前面，面部扭曲——从此，每当她读到“因愤怒而扭曲”这几个字时，艾瑞思总能想起比利的母亲——满是怒火。她简直就是那场会议中的比利的女版。他继承了她的眼睛——“黑色火焰”不足以形容它们——虽然她的更大一些。除此之外，他还长着她又小又圆的鼻头和不太厚的嘴唇。他们的头发都黑中带红棕色，略长，稍盖住耳朵，没过脖子。甚至他们两人的气场——他们的小身板像火山爆发一样喷出出人意料的愤怒。</p><p>　　如果不是此时此刻的情况，看着他们发火也挺有意思的。</p><p>　　“你姥姥关心你又怎么了？！”妈妈对着门大喊。比利的姥姥——一个和他们一样身材矮小但略胖、满头白发的老太太——来串了个门。一开始一切还好。姥姥叨叨了半天她的外孙，一脸笑容的看着她叫的“家里的新成员”。尽管她耳背，她还是问了他们的身体好不好、吃的怎么样、以后有啥打算（说到这儿的时候，艾瑞思感觉比利有点不耐烦地挪动了一下）、身体好不好（那股烦躁加剧了）、过去发生了什么（烦躁减轻了些）、那些精灵长啥样（烦躁消失了）、他们吃得好不好（<em>哎呀，完了，</em>艾瑞思心想），最后问到他的身体好不好（<em>比利，冷静！冷静！</em>她用心灵感应对他说）。然后姥姥掏出两个装着红色钞票的红包要塞给他们，让他们拿去吃点好的。这时候比利彻底失控了。</p><p>　　平静和混乱就这么成了一秒钟的两半，这比石子激起浪花还快。就连现在艾瑞思也不知道<em>到底</em>是怎么发生的。她见识到了一场涉及到母亲和儿子、母亲和女儿、还有姥姥和外孙的三边争吵。现在，闷闷不乐的姥姥正陷在沙发里看报纸。<em>她是不是已经习惯这些吵架了？</em>艾瑞思一边轻轻地扶着妈妈的肩头带她进客厅一边想。妈妈并没有像艾瑞思想的那样喘着粗气。<em>够怪的……</em>她心里笑着。</p><p>　　“他在外面也这样？”妈妈质问。“每句话都个婢养的要顺着他，要不然他就当翻脸猴子？”</p><p>　　实话应该是“有时候”，但艾瑞思嘴上说的是“不”。“他平时在家里也这样吗？”</p><p>　　“你刚才没看见？”妈妈一屁股坐到沙发里，顺手把橡胶手套一摔。“那么多年里他姥姥好不容易来见他一回，他就这样？艾瑞思，我告诉你，以后看着点儿。也就是你好，能看得上他。就这么个小地把豆子还有个破脾气，瘦得和根棍儿一样——”艾瑞思咳嗽了一声，想盖住她的笑。</p><p>　　“怎么啦？没感冒吧？”姥姥立刻问道。</p><p>　　“嗯？没啊，姥姥，我没事儿。”</p><p>　　“你穿的太少啦！赶紧再披件衣服！”</p><p>　　尽管艾瑞思觉得在家里上面穿一件长袖衬衫、外面套着毛线背心，下面穿秋裤和毛线袜子绝对够了，但她还是说她等一会儿就穿。妈妈还没说完。</p><p>　　“——不是我嫌弃你，但他一个嫚儿都不配！”</p><p>　　“哎呀，妈妈，他挺好的，”艾瑞思强忍着笑。“很会关心人啊。妈，他容易不耐烦就是了，真没别的了——”</p><p>　　“他就这个臭毛病！”</p><p>　　“哎呀……他可能是这么长时间了，不适应别人问东问西的，毕竟他好久没回家住了不是——也不是说你们哪做错了。”她抱了妈妈一下。“嗯——我知道在哪里能找到他，让我去跟他说吧？”</p><p>　　“去那个婢养的潮巴，不用管他！等着他死大街上就知道教训了。”</p><p>　　<em>让他死大街上可比让他回来难的多呢……</em>艾瑞思想。</p><p>　　“我去把他找回来。”她又抱了抱姥姥。 　　 　　<em>唉，你呀你……</em>艾瑞思在门外摇了摇头，终于笑了。</p><center>**</center><p>　　<em>人呢？</em>艾瑞思通过心灵感应问。</p><p>　　<em>栈桥。２路车栈桥下。</em>比利没多说一个字。</p><p>　　<em>还生气呐？</em>他没反应。她不耐烦地叹了口气。<em>我来了。</em></p><p>　　她一出门就把围巾拉到了鼻子上。头顶的天空是灰蒙蒙的一片，而不是艾瑞思所熟悉的湛蓝色。天上连太阳都看不见。她在刚到的第一天早晨就问，一个城市怎么能成这个样子。比利回答说，它就是这个样了。“脑残和虚荣，再加上眼缺。他们也不评估一下后果就乱发展，结果发展太快，他们自己都应付不过来。这也不全是政府的问题，有些企业也没多少文凭。”她感觉呼吸并不困难，可是一旦想起来雾霾里飘着的是什么，艾瑞思就感觉不舒服。<em>这压抑的灰色也真是应情。</em>她想。</p><p>　　尽管别人告诉她圣诞节在中国不是官方节日，但她仍看到许多和它相关的装饰。铜版纸质的圣诞花圈被贴在商铺的窗户上，胖乎乎的圣诞老人头像在玻璃门上对着外面笑。有的买电子产品的店里在天花板上挂了彩灯，它们的店员都二三十岁的样子，也戴了圣诞帽。有一个四层的商场大楼在外墙壁上打着“圣诞特惠，部分商品半价销售”的大广告，尽管它的入口出没有门，而是两道厚厚的绿门帘（艾瑞思估计是为了挡风保暖），上面什么也贴不了，但在入口外面还是立了一个特别突兀的圣诞树，红黄蓝三种颜色的挂饰一个不落。</p><p>　　她依旧害怕独自走在大街上。街上的人群总是让她感觉太压抑。不过还好，今天路上的人并不多，大多数都围在路边卖小吃的摊子旁。这些摊子其实是一个个的推车，上面锅碗瓢盆灶和天然气样样齐全，有的还配了热铁板。用的食料都在看起来像油的东西里翻炒（但如果真的是油的话看起来也未免太黑太恶心了……）。推车外面贴着广告，红底黄字写着小吃名字：新疆烤串炸鸡排关东煮、章鱼丸子臭豆腐摊蛋饼、煎饼果子青岛锅贴甜沫……艾瑞思闻到它们油乎乎的味道不禁邹了眉头。也许在一个更干净点的地方，这些真的算是美食吧，但在大街上就不好说了……卖小吃的商贩有老有少,但顾客都是年轻人。商贩们穿着羽绒服，专注地低头翻炒，时不时抬头递一下食物，或者问刚探过头来的顾客，“要啥？”“多少钱？”顾客会回问。</p><p>　　小吃的商摊之间是卖电子器材和各种其他东西的低矮摊子。艾瑞思发现他们几乎卖任何能合法卖地东西，不管是本子、纸模型、袜子，还是衣服、手机壳、望远镜，甚至是铜指虎（她也只能猜它们是可以合法买卖的），什么都有。人们边走边用眼扫着路过的摊子，同时小心翼翼的，看到远处来送外卖的摩托就早早地躲得远远的。有的人停下来讨价还价，或者拿起物品翻来覆去地看，看完了就放下（比如说指虎）。有一两个年轻人在人行道中间发传单。艾瑞思出于礼貌谢着收下了，但委婉地拒绝了另一个特别热情地介绍他们的健身房的小哥。他一个劲儿地喊着“美女美女”这个流行称呼。在她看来，这也是挺好的一个“敬称”，仿佛给雾霾里送上了一道光。</p><p>　　一群海鸥箭一般飞过海浪抛起的泡沫，他们欢乐兴奋的叫声在大海的呼吸里回荡。一股熟悉的大海的咸味扑面而来，艾瑞思特别想深呼吸，但忍住了。<em>这多像纳伦之星那里的味道啊……老纳尔怎么样了啊？</em>她一定要想个办法给那个老精灵守塔人发个信，今天是冬至，他是要按照精灵传统来过的。</p><p>　　<em>也许老纳尔会喜欢这个地方。</em>她想，在路口等着绿灯。这个城市是一个各种时期的建筑大杂烩，有的建筑都有一百多年了。在快速路的一个下路口，她看到一个老教堂——倒不如说是一个老修道院。它不大，陈旧的红砖围出了一个小庭院。庭院一角站着一个五六层的塔，顶上是个粗粗的砖头十字架。塔底是一个形状丰满的礼堂，两个部分形成一个直角，两端凸出来的应该是礼堂里面的壁龛。整座建筑并没有多神圣或者多么有震慑感，反倒是又老又破又缺保养，像一个守着自己的窝的老守财奴。<em>真可笑，</em>艾瑞思想，<em>简直就是它崇拜的宗教的化身。</em>再往下，她看到了新建的公寓，外表新涂着浅黄色，十多层高。透过楼和楼的间隙，艾瑞思却看到了贫民窟，院子里横竖着晾衣线。再走走，路两边就出现了两层高的商铺，它们看上去像是有五十多年了，在还不至于被称为“摩天楼”的高楼对面蹲着。人行道上没有多少人，那些商铺也看起来过了气。这一路的景象和万花筒一样多样，但又衔接的那么自然。新旧建筑都不是特别突兀，和一条裙子上的补丁一样。<em>嗯，老纳菲亚斯肯定会喜欢这里的。</em></p><p>　　路上的司机仿佛瞎了眼，无视信号灯和行人。绿灯亮的时候，她迅速随两旁的人群快步跑了过去。过马路也需要勇气（更多的是鲁莽）。<em>算了……反正我现在就凭直觉找到他就行了。</em></p><p>　　但她的注意力被离岸不远的一座亭子牢牢抓住了。亭子在一堆石头砌成的台子上，被一条石头砌的走道与岸边相连。大冬天里青岛没有多少游客，但那个亭子那里还是聚集了一群人。亭子顶是典型的中国风，铺满了红陶瓦，形状像撑开的雨伞一样，黄琉璃的屋脊从顶端向下延伸，尾端向上翘，上面是各种神兽的雕像。<em>它们都是什么？</em>艾瑞思想，<em>中国石像鬼?屋顶下是亭子第二层，第二层下面是第一层的屋顶。</em></p><p>　　艾瑞思倚到海边的栏杆上，想仔细看看。</p><p>　　“嘿。”她左边传来一个声音，“马路过得还行？”</p><p>　　“你在这儿啊！”艾瑞思飞快转头。比利看上去比他走的时候冷静了许多。“你感觉好些了吗？”</p><p>　　“我回来的时候总是不敢过马路。看到你安全过来我就放心咯。”</p><p>　　“这可不是在回答我的问题啊……”</p><p>　　他什么都没说，只是对着海浪和海鸥拉长了脸发呆。</p><p>　　“顺便说一下，我是自己要来的。”说完，艾瑞思又回头看那座亭子。有人坐在花岗岩的围栏上探身看着海。大海，作为回应，把浪甩在石头台子一侧，像一个野兽试图咬它的猎物。</p><p>　　“那是回澜阁，清末在一个老码头的一头开始建的，在1933年民国的时候才建完。”比利瞟了一眼，说。“它的名字字面意思是‘回旋的波涛’,但对于这座亭子来说没啥引申义。”</p><p>　　“你以前到过那儿嘛？”</p><p>　　“嗯，但我不记得多少了……你要是愿意的话我现在就带你去。”</p><p>　　“嗯……今天就算了。明天吧？”</p><p>　　“行。”他点点头，顿了顿，又开始说，“这个地方就是以那个码头命名的。它是个栈桥，因为它的结构它现在还叫‘栈桥’。你知道吧，就是一堆木头像三角一样支起来，顶着上面的木板？”他拿胳膊比划给她看。“等我在那上面走的时候已经是下面是石头上面是石头板了。一开始它是个军用卸货码头……一直用到大港小港建好了以后。我记得好像几年前一个台风把它吹塌了。他们又用石头把它补好了。”</p><p>　　“哇哦……”</p><p>　　“我妈和我爸以前带我到那个走道上钓过鱼捞过螃蟹，但我那时候害怕螃蟹腿乱动，也不敢真用手去抓。”他语音单调地说。</p><p>　　“小螃蟹？”</p><p>　　“嗯，还有沙子里的蛤蜊，礁石上的海蛎子，小波螺。海潮把好多东西带到岸上来，有时候甚至有小鱼，但它们现在也没有了。”他叹口气，然后更活泼了点：“我当时从来没学会游泳。我爸有一次把我从沙滩上劫走了，然后问了好玩儿，把他自己连带着我一起扔进了海里。呵……我跟你说，鼻孔里进海水可不好玩儿。”艾瑞思咯咯地笑了，“……裤头被海浪打歪了被个阿姨看到也一样……尽管才五岁。”他脸色一沉，但她笑得更欢了，挽起他的胳膊倚了过去。“喜欢这儿吗？”他轻声问。</p><p>　　“嗯。要是没雾霾就更好了。你呢？”</p><p>　　“不知道。”他咬了咬嘴唇。“它是我家。我自然比任何一个地方更喜欢它，但是……就说马路吧。司机都恶心的要命，一群睁眼瞎。人行道上贴满了小广告——有次一个婢养的把个广告贴到了我姥姥背上。一堆干正常工作学历不高的人装着逼，假装自己品德高尚品味高贵。对自己的便利大于他人的生命——你肯定看见那些送外卖的摩托了。那些破烂房如果好好翻新的话可能会变成城市标志，但结果呢？被扔那儿接着烂。看看我家后面的破平房，再看看这边的‘优秀历史建筑’……知道我去学院前他们自己叫这个地方什么吗？‘镶着金边的抹布’。粗俗和贫困被贴了层现代和繁华的金。”</p><p>　　艾瑞思瞪圆了眼看着他。</p><p>　　“至少你还有个家……”她悄声说，没控制住自己。她想起了自己来的地方，一个战火纷飞的平行世界里的一座城市。她可恨那里了。他们每天都在灰蒙蒙的硝烟下过日子，在已经塌了的墙角里躲火炮。在街上，他们只想着死和生存两件事。尽管如此，艾瑞思还是能发现一些可爱的东西：一些小玩意儿，像一只蝴蝶或一次日落。有一次，她在一个俯瞰城市的山头上看到了为数不多的云散开的景象。云后面露出来的是一个太阳，它把天空当作画布，在上面泼了绯红淡粉嫩绿金黄的墨。泼完之后，太阳把画布扯下来披在城市上。这个效果就像往一个臭脾气的老太太身上披了一条色彩艳丽的裙子和戴了一顶鲜花帽子，既可笑又可爱。“……而且不管你说什么，你都还爱它。”</p><p>　　“我不知道。”他说。然后，他反应过来艾瑞思说的什么，又补充道，“对不起。”</p><p>　　“你该道歉的不是我。”艾瑞思说的有点生硬。“你对家人也这个感觉吗？”没回答。“为什么？”她能看出他心里在作斗争，一边是撒谎，另一边是更伤她的心。她知道他多骄傲，也猜出了他会选什么。他的胳膊紧了一下，然后开始颤抖。她做了心理准备：“你的姥姥只是在关心你啊，不是吗？”</p><p>　　“然而，”他从牙缝里挤了出来，“她就是这个毛病！”</p><p>　　<em>我好像在哪里听过这句话？</em>艾瑞思扭过头轻轻笑了笑。</p><p>　　“她总是就和我没什么用、不会照顾自己一样——‘你穿的暖和不暖和？’‘有菜没？’‘有水果没？’‘姥姥给你些钱，别饿着自己，周末买点好吃的！’我为什么生气？她一遍一遍地叨叨，我怎么能不烦得上火——不只是过去两个周，艾瑞思，是我他妈的整个一生——我还反复跟她说，我不用她给钱，我知道该怎么过！她干嘛不把钱用她自己身上？为什么她就听不懂那个该死的‘不’字的意思？这不只是关心了，艾瑞思，这就是唠叨和烦人。</p><p>　　“就好像我没心没肺似的；就好像我妈跟我说，我姥姥成天惦记着我我我，把我当成她的掌中宝一样的时候我没感觉似的。但我就是恨她溺爱——它差点毁了我，而且说实话，”他朝海里吐了口唾沫，“她的耳聋也帮不上什么忙。”</p><p>　　“‘恨’也太强烈了吧……”</p><p>　　“但我就是这么觉着。”</p><p>　　艾瑞思感觉很难反驳他。她明白他的感受，也由此想到了她离开“家”前的日子。姥姥让她想起了好久以前在她住的孤儿院里工作的一个看护助理。她——卡米拉——关心人关心得都有些过分了。他们还好吗？他们暖和吗？他们咳嗽了——是病了吗？艾瑞思在卡米拉来的时候总是拿本书挡住脸，不让她看到自己的烦躁。即便如此，她还是会过来微笑着问关于书的问题：讲的什么，喜欢吗，最后，“你看起来脸色有点苍白啊，艾瑞思，去林子里面呼吸一下新鲜空气吧？”她怎么就不能和其他助理一样不去管她？直到她十六岁生日的时候，艾瑞思才有了答案。那天晚上，卡米拉把她叫到她的屋子里，抱住她说：“你现在是大姑娘了，艾瑞思。我知道你很坚强，但每次我看到你瘦瘦小小的，我总是忍不住把你当作我的妹妹，而我必须护好你。”<em>哦。</em>艾瑞思在拥抱最初感到的反感一下子化成了理解。<em>原来是这样。</em>“我以前也是个孤儿，”怪不得她总是管来管去的，艾瑞思想。“我的护士是个特好的夫人。我过十六岁生日的时候，她给了我这个。你让我想起了我自己，所以……给。也不知道该送你什么别的礼物了……”那个平安结形状的水晶挂坠从此就没离开过她的脖子。</p><p>　　“你怎么能怪一个人做他唯一能做的事呢……？”艾瑞思没想说出声。</p><p>　　“呣？”</p><p>　　“啊……”她该怎么和他说啊？他现在闹着脾气，是不会听进去的。但她还是得试试看。“如果……如果几十年后，我也变得‘叨叨’，那你也会恨我吗？”她很瞧不起这种修辞方法，因为这简直就是道德绑架。<em>一个人有时总得打自己脸。</em>她想。他没说话。她在他的肩上挪了挪头，想找一个舒服点的位置。让她很不爽的是，他瘦得要命，以至于他的肩骨隔着他的毛衣和大衣都很硌人。“我知道你不会一下子就改变想法，但你至少对姥姥更耐心点，好吗?你走的这些日子里她还能做什么啊？你也不常跟别人提起你的家人。”她没想说的那么直白。比利哼了一声。</p><p>　　一群游客经过，朝着海鸥扔坚果和面包屑。鸟群飞过，海浪打湿了它们的羽毛。海涛声淹没了……所有事物的呐喊。艾瑞思终于勉强把头放舒服了。她半闭着眼，听着周围的世界：风声，海声，海鸥声，马路上的交通声，脚步声，甚至是比利的呼吸声——一切都节奏一致地起起伏伏。世界是一个摇篮，空气是被子，轻轻地摇着她。她感觉自己回到了纳伦之星，然后又回到了学院所在的那个岛上，同时她又在这里。哎呀，怎么还可以这样？大海施放着一个如此古老的魔法，无论是谁，无论他们来自哪个平行世界，他们都没法抵抗。 　　 　　“你们两个人都知道……你不会在这里永远待着的……姥姥也不会的。”她的声音很轻。“原谅她，和她道歉，好嘛？”她抬起头。微微的海风吹动起她的长发和他的长袍。他好久都没有说话。</p><p>　　“被你说总比被我妈说好。”比利脸又一沉。</p><p>　　“来嘛？”她微微一笑。</p><p>　　“不来。”他哼道。</p><p>　　“那就早点回家。别感冒了啊。”她亲了他一下，把胳膊从他的那里滑了出来。她听到他咂了下舌。</p><center>**</center><p>　　 　　<em>嗯……我尽力了……</em>艾瑞思推开门的时候心想。</p><p>　　“他人呢？”妈妈从厨房里问。</p><p>　　“他待会儿再到。他想看看一个书店。”她撒了个谎。“我不是很感兴趣。”</p><p>　　“他早晚死在个书堆里。”妈妈说。“别管他——去洗个手，我来教你包饺子。今天冬至，那个彪儿就一直没学会过。”姥姥在她的身后往皮上放陷。艾瑞思忽然感觉来了劲儿，跳着去洗手。</p><p>　　半个小时后，锁“咔嗒”一下开了。比利站在门框里，头发被风吹的乱了套，长袍裹得紧紧的。艾瑞思微笑着看着他，给他打劲。他瞟了她一眼，像是在做准备。</p><p>　　“姥姥，对……不起。”</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>"Don't be nervous, alright? I'll wait for you on the other side." Billy soothed. "Just do what they say, and answer whatever question they ask. Most likely they'll check your passport and visa, that's all."</p><p>"Would they understand me?" Iris looked around. The customs was full of people: in the expansive, brightly-lit hall, a sea of black-haired people milled about. A row of belts separated it in half. On one side was the open space, and on the other, a labyrinth of more belt fences. Two long lines snaked through this maze. They went around and around the passage, around pillars, upon which the TV screens showed the usual "prepare your passport" and "if you have items to declare".</p><a id="more"></a><p>Most of the people were Chinese: black-haired, some darker-skinned and looking uncouth (with their big, rough hands, padded with callous, labored arduously over wheat or rice), and some lighter-skinned, looking pampered or humble (students with thin-wired glasses and heavy backpacks or in flashy clothes, carrying small bags on one arm, their make-ups miraculously intact after the long flight). There were foreigners, too, taking up more space than others, but much quieter, though no less chatty. Iris heard a fat lady telling her kids to shut up and keep going. A few student-looking foreigners walked with wide eyes, not quite sure what was happening or where to go. Only the customs staff and the airport personnel in green or blue uniforms moved around with calm, directing people to their respective lines.</p><p>"Yep, you'll be fine. They can understand English." He took off his amulet. "Here, take this. It'll translate whatever you say into the language you want. Just touch it before you use it and think about the language you want to translate into—relax!" He laughed as Iris looked rather uncertain. "I'll see you on the other side! Come to think of it, I might get out earlier than you do."</p><p>She nodded, still tense, tucking the amulet inside her clothes. He pushed her gently into the line saying "Foreign visitors and immigrants". Iris swayed behind a student on headphones and looked back. Billy was drowned in a sea of down coats.</p><p>She frowned down at her passport. She had zero affinity to the blue booklet. The eagle emblem and the gilded "United States of America" meant nothing to her. <em>Not my country, not my world. Only a substitute for what I've lost. Quite a useful one, though.</em> She thought. The Academy that they belonged to must have had people inside the government or something. When, years ago, she left the Isle to get away from everything, Robbie had told her to wait for a few days for the documents to be ready. The "document" turned out to be this passport. She had thought the Academy would have its own special document with access to every country, but Robbie, their friend who took over the leadership position then, had laughed and shaken his head.</p><p>"No, I thought so, too, until now. Apparently we need an ordinary passport like everyone else. We have connections inside our respective governments, though… Nobody cared to mention this to us at all! Madam Jane Scruggs, who led the Academy when Billy and I first joined, simply forgot to tell her successor, Margaret! It's hilarious to think about it, I mean, Scruggs went to the Council after leaving but have actually met us thousands of times over the years."</p><p>"I'm surprised that my passport is still a thing." Billy had replied. "I wonder what the Elves use."</p><p>"They got their own ships and tricks, man." Robbie reminded him.</p><p>It'd be good to have tricks of their own, too. Iris wasn't really comfortable with all the crowd. Perhaps it was because of her living in a place isolated from it for so long, or maybe it was her past. Naren Star wasn't exactly a tourist attraction, nor Kryoth—the town beside the lighthouse—a city; back in her earlier year, a crowd meant death, a massacre. Here, everyone was looking at their cellphones, occasionally raising their head to check the line progress, faces looked pale from the flight. A few people tried to make calls. She wondered if Billy, had he a phone, would do the same. She had asked him how he managed to convince his parents to send him to a place that taught "sword and magic", as he and Robbie had joked with her the first day she was there. He wasn't sent, he said, but rather <em>happened</em> to be there. His flight crashed, and unbelievably, had survived because one of his friends shut the four of them (Robbie among them) into a toilet—</p><p>"Are you serious?" She had snorted despite herself.</p><p>"No, I'm dead." He rolled his eyes.</p><p>So when he went home and met his family for the first time after that, he had already been trained for two years. Iris always figured that, knowing Billy, the delay was deliberate. He seldom mentioned his family, which made her wonder where the idea of a visit home came from.</p><p>The guy in front of her moved up to a booth, and a woman in black uniform directed Iris to another. The officer behind the desk checked her visa (<em>Thanks, our connection-in-the-government,</em> she thought, heart hammering) and said with a sing-song accent, "four fingers on the sensor, please… and the other four. Done."</p><p>Iris breathed out in relief a few minutes later when she saw Billy coming out, dragging their enormous trunks. She couldn't help but smile.</p><p>"Ha, I was out first!" She quipped.</p><center>**</center><p><em>Well, that's unexpected.</em> Iris thought as the door slammed shut, hard.</p><p>"Ungrateful urchin!" His mother roared at the door her son just disappeared through. "Disrespectful brat! Don't you ever come back, you fucking bastard of a bitch!"</p><p>"Mom! But mom! He's your <em>own son</em>!" Iris' eyes went wide.</p><p>"I haven't a bloody son like that!"</p><p>Iris had never seen anyone so angry before. The last time Billy got mad was when a plan for a rescue mission didn't went through and people had died because of it. He shouted insults for five minutes when he had heard the news, and didn't really manage to bottle it down <em>in</em> the meeting, either. When everyone was sitting in a morose room, saying "it should not have happened", as the head of the Academy he banged on the table every few sentences, excoriating every Council member involved. The heat seemed to have carried over time and landed onto this woman in front of Iris. Small, back arched, finger pointing in front of her, face contorted—from then on, whenever she read the expression "contorted with anger", Iris was reminded of Billy's mother—with vehement rage; the woman was a female version of Billy in that meeting. He shared her eyes— "black flames" alone wasn't a sufficient description for them right now, though hers were bigger—her small, round nose, and her thin lips. Their hairs were both black, tinged with a light reddish brown, only slightly covering their ears and down to the neck. Even their aura—unexpected energy exploded from their small frames like magma from a volcano.</p><p>It was quite comical to watch if not for the situation.</p><p>"What the frack's wrong with your grandma caring about you?!" Mother bellowed at the door. Billy's grandmother—an old lady, equally small, plump and white-haired with small, round eyes—paid a visit. It was alright while she fussed all over her grandson and beaming at "the new member of the family", as she called it. She asked (despite her deafness) about his health, their dietary, their plans (here, Iris felt Billy shift with a bit of annoyance), his health (the annoyance increased), what has passed (the annoyance subsided a little), what the Elves looked like (the annoyance abated), their dietaries while there (<em>uh-oh</em>, Iris thought), and his health (<em>Billy, calm down!</em> She reached out telepathically), but he had lost it when grandma took out two red packets with red bills and stuffed each into their hands, telling him to buy stuff to eat.</p><p>The moment of peace was then forever severed by that precise second. The pandemonium broke out faster than ripples forming in a pond by a pebble. Even now Iris wasn't sure exactly <em>how</em> it happened. There were shouting from everyone and a three-way shouting match between the mother and the son, the mother and the daughter, and the grandson and the grandma. Now the distraught grandma collapsed in the sofa reading newspapers. <em>Was she used to these outbursts?</em> Iris wondered as she held gently mother's shoulders and led her into the living room. Mother wasn't breathing heavily as Iris thought. <em>Weird people…</em> she laughed inside her.</p><p>"Is he like that when he's out there, too?" Mother demanded. "Every word must fit his damn mood or he'll turn his face faster than a cheeky monkey?"</p><p>The honest answer was "sometimes", but Iris replied "no". "Was he like that at home often?"</p><p>"What, didn't you just see it?" Mother smashed the cushions of the sofa with her butt and slapped down her rubber gloves. "First time in years his grandma sees him and <em>this</em> is what he does. I tell you, Iris, be careful when later. I suppose only you're good enough to take him. A midget of a boy with an irascible temper, thin as a stick—" Iris laughed a little but turned it quickly into a cough.</p><p>"Are you alright? Are you cold?" Grandma immediately asked.</p><p>"Hmm? No, no I'm fine, grandma."</p><p>"You aren't wearing enough! Put on another layer!"</p><p>Though Iris was sure that wearing a yarn vest over a long-sleeved shirt and sweatpants and socks were more than enough for indoors, she still said she'd do that later. Mother was still going.</p><p>"—not that I have a grudge on you, but he doesn't deserve any girls!"</p><p>"Oh, he's fine, really." Iris tried to hold back her smile. "Really caring, if anything! C'mon, mom, he's just a bit impatient, that's all—"</p><p>"Well, that's <em>exactly</em> his goddamn problem!"</p><p>"Oh mom…. Maybe he isn't used to people being so inquisitive after all this time; he's not home for a long time, after all—not that you're wrong to care about him or anything." She gave mom a hug. "Look, I think I know where to find him. I'll go talk to him, alright?"</p><p>"Damn the brat, just leave him be! Let him die in the streets and then it'll teach him the lesson!"</p><p><em>That'll be harder than coaxing him back home.</em> Iris thought.</p><p>"I'll get him back." she hugged grandma, too.</p><p><em>Oh, Billy…</em> Iris shook her head outside and finally let the smile bloom.</p><center>**</center><p><em>Where are you?</em> Iris called telepathically.</p><p><em>The Pier. Take bus No. 2. Get off at the Pier stop.</em> Came Billy's curt reply.</p><p><em>Still angry?</em> No reply. She let out an exasperated sigh. <em>I'm coming.</em></p><p>She pulled the scarf up to her nose the moment she stepped out of the apartment. The sky was a murky grey instead of the blue that Iris was used to. There wasn't a sun at all. When she asked how a city could be like this the first morning she spent in the city, Billy replied that it was how it was. "Stupidity and hubris, coupled with myopia. They developed too fast before they even assessed the consequences. Not all the government's fault, either. The enterprises themselves weren't so learned." It didn't feel hard to breathe, but knowing what floated in the smog made Iris uncomfortable. <em>The oppressing grey was quite fitting for the mood,</em> she thought.</p><p>Though she had been told that Christmas wasn't official in China, she still saw a lot of related decorations. Glossy pictures of Christmas wreaths were pasted onto shop windows, and the chubby Santa's heads smiled from inside the glass doors. A few shops selling electronics hung lights along the ceiling and their staff, all somewhere around late twenties and early thirties, wore Santa hats. Even in front of the entrance of a big four-story store that sported huge advertisements on its side saying "CHRISTMAS SALE, 50% off on selected electronics", which wasn't able to have anything stuck to its thick green curtains (to keep out of the wind, Iris figured), there stood a quite erratic Christmas tree, complete with red, yellow, and blue ornaments.</p><p>She was still a little scared of walking around this city alone. The too many people in the streets were oppressive for her. To her relief, the sidewalk today was not so packed; most of the people huddled around food stalls. The carts were fully equipped with a gas tank, a stove, and woks (hotplates, in some cases). The food were cooked in what would be oil had it not looked so dark and disgusting. The front sides of the carts were plastered by advertisements, yellow words in red background: CHICKEN FILLETS, XINJIANG KABEB, KANTO NI, OCTOPUS MEATBALL, STINKY TOFU, OMELETTE, CHINESE CRÉPES, POTSTICKERS… Iris couldn't help but frown at the greasy odor they emitted. Perhaps, in a more sanitary place, these would be a delicacy, but not here on the streets… The vendors were a mixture of young and old, but the customers were all youths. In their down coats, the vendors worked with concentration, looking up from time to time to hand over food or ask those who peeked over, "Anything?" "How much?" would be the reply.</p><p>Between the food vendors were low stalls selling electronics or other accessories. Iris realized that they could sell almost <em>anything</em> legal, from notebooks to paper models to socks to clothes to phone cases to binoculars to even brass knuckles (which she could only assume were legal). People walking glanced at the passing stalls all the while giving the obnoxious motorcycles sending take-outs charging down the sidewalk a wide berth. Some stopped to haggle, or picked up wares to examine, only to put it down (like the knuckles). A few young people passed out flyers in the middle of the sidewalk; Iris thanked one briefly and accepted out of manners while politely declined another, who was rather enthusiastic about his gym, calling her "beauty" by the way of a modern trend. Quite an honorific title, in her opinion. It sort of brought a light through the smog.</p><center>**</center><p>A flock of seagulls lanced through the foams thrown into the air by the waves. Their jubilant cries echoed in the breathing of the sea. A familiar salty air filled Iris' lungs. She refrained herself from breathing deeply, but the scent reminded her so much of Naren Star. How was old Nar doing? She got to send a message to the old Elven lighthouse keeper somehow; today was Winter Solstice and he would celebrate it as per Elven custom.</p><p><em>Maybe Old Nar' would like this place.</em> She thought, waiting for the green light at a crossing. The city was a hodgepodge of architectures from different ages, some were well over a century. At a crossing on the expressway, she saw an old church—a monastery, more like: small, old red bricks entrammeled a tiny courtyard, and a five- or six-storied tower with a thick brick cross on top stood in one of its corners, backed-up by a rotund chapel (its two wings coming at a right angle) forming the two sides of the courtyard. A round bulge, the niche from inside, bulged out at the chapel's either end. The whole thing wasn't intimidating or holy: it was run-down and had aged badly, like an old miser guarding his lair. <em>How pathetic,</em> Iris thought, <em>such an accurate embodiment of the religion it worshipped</em>. Further down the way, she saw modern apartments build recently, light yellow and new, standing over ten stories tall. Through the gaps, however, Iris thought she saw old hamlets: glimpses of yards in which laundry lines crisscrossed. Then there were more two-story shops from what looked like fifty years ago squatting across from corporate buildings not tall enough to be skyscrapers. Few people walked along the road, and the shops looked like past their prime. It was diverse, like a kaleidoscope. Yet, everything seemed to fit in smoothly. Neither the new buildings nor the old ones looked out of place, like a patch on a dress. <em>Yes, Old Nar'fiius would love it here.</em></p><p>Drivers here seemed to be blind to both the traffic lights and the pedestrians. When the green light came on, she scurried quickly across with the mob gathered on her end of the crossing. It was an act that required courage (more like recklessness), crossing the road. <em>Anyway… all I need to do now is to follow my guts and find him.</em></p><p>Her attention, though, was caught fast by a pavilion not far out in the sea, raised on rocks, connected to the land by a walkway also constructed with blocks of stones. There weren't many tourists in winter, yet the pavilion still gathered a crowd. Its roof was of classical Chinese design: red and covered with terracotta tiles, shaped like an open umbrella, and the glazed yellow spines that led away from the pinnacle sloped downward before ending with an upward curve. On the curve were statuettes of mythical beasts. <em>What are they?</em> Iris wondered. <em>Chinese gargoyles?</em> Under the roof was the second story of the pavilion, which was set on the roof (equally tiled and curved as the roof above) of the first.</p><p>Iris leaned against the fence by the sea to get a better look.</p><p>"Hey." A voice came from her left. "Crossed the road alright?"</p><p>"There you are!" Iris whirled around. Billy looked calmer than when he had left. "How are you feeling?"</p><p>"I always feel scared to cross the streets when I get back. Good to see you made it without a sweat."</p><p>"That's not answering my question…"</p><p>He said nothing but frowned at the waves and the gulls.</p><p>"I came on my own accord, if you are wondering." With that, Iris returned her gaze at the pavilion. Some people sat on the granite barriers around the rock platform, leaning over to look at the sea. The sea responded by slamming waves against the side of the platform, like a beast snapping at its prey.</p><p>"That's the Huilan Pavilion, built at the end of an old pier from Qing Dynasty, and finished in 1933, the time of the Republic of China." Billy said with a glance. "Its name literally means 'spinning waves', by the way, but figuratively it says nothing about the pavilion itself."</p><p>"Have you been there before?"</p><p>"Yes, though I couldn't remember much… I can take you there now, if you want."</p><p>"Umm… not today. Maybe tomorrow?"</p><p>"Sure." He nodded. After a pause, he started again, "That pier is this place's namesake. It was a trestle pier, and is still called the 'Trestle Pier', because of its structure. You know, wooden beams arranged like 'A' to support wooden planks on top?" He folded his hands to show her. "By the time I walked on there, it was stone supports beneath and a stone-paved walkway above. Originally it was used as a military loading pier… until the Ports Major and Minor were built. That walkway collapsed some years ago because of a rare typhoon that went up here, I think. They reinforced it with stones."</p><p>"Wow…"</p><p>"Mom and dad had taken me on the walkway to fish for small crabs before, but I was too scared of the wiggling legs to actually touch them." He continued in monotone.</p><p>"Small crabs?"</p><p>"Yeah, and clams in the sand, oysters on the reefs, and small conches. The tide brings a lot of things to the beach, even schools of small fishes. But they are here no more." He let out a breath, and continued a little more lively, "I've never learnt swimming back then. My dad once hijacked me off the beach and dumped himself and me into the waves for fun. Well, I can tell you, having seawater in your nostrils is anything but fun." Iris giggled. "… nor was having your underwear knocked askew by the current and getting it pointed out by a woman stranger… even if you're five." He scowled, but she laughed harder, wrapping her arm around his and leant on him. "Do you like it here?" He breathed.</p><p>"Yep, though it would be better without the smog. What about you?"</p><p>"I don't know." He bit his lip. "It's my home. I prefer it more than anywhere else, but… take the street I mentioned. The drivers are disgusting, blind to everything. The sidewalks are patched with advertisements—once a son of a bitch stuck one of those on my grandma's back. People with little education doing ordinary jobs but acting like snobs. Convenience of self is placed before the lives of others. I'm sure you've seen the motorcycles sending take-aways. Run-down buildings could've become city icons if restored correctly but left to rot. Just look at the differences between the hamlet behind my apartment and the 'historical sites' here… Know what we call this city before I joined the Academy? 'A rag with a gilded edge'. Vulgarity and poverty under the veneer of modernism and prosperity."</p><p>Iris stared.</p><p>"At least you still have a home…" She whispered, unable to refrain herself, thinking about where she was from, a city in a parallel, war-torn world. How she hated there. They lived their lives under a grey sulfur cloud every day, keeping to the already tumbling walls for safety from projectiles. Only two things filled their minds when they were out in the streets: death and survival. But even in there Iris had found beauty: small things, like a butterfly, or a sunset. Once, on a hill overlooking the city, she saw the rare sight of clouds parting. What it revealed was a sun using the sky as canvas, dabbing it crimson and pink and green and yellow. After it was done, the sun drew down the sheet and threw it over the city. The effect was like wrapping a piece of vibrant dress and a flowery bonnet over a grouchy old woman. It was hilarious and adorable at the same time. "…and you love it, no matter what you say."</p><p>"I don't know." He said. Then, realizing what Iris had just whispered, he added, "I'm sorry."</p><p>"It's not me you should apologize to." Iris said stiffly. "Is this how you feel about your family, too?" Silence. "Why?" He was struggling with himself, she could see. It was a choice between lying and hurting her feelings more. Knowing his pride, she knew which one he would choose. His arm tensed and started to quiver. She braced for it. "Your grandma was caring for you, wasn't she?"</p><p>"Which," he squeezed through his gritted teeth, "is <em>exactly</em> her goddamn problem!"</p><p><em>Where have I heard those words before?</em> Iris turned her face away to chuckle.</p><p>"Always acting like I'm useless and know nothing about caring for myself— 'Are you dressed warm?' 'Have you vegetables?' 'Have you fruits?' 'Granny's some money for you; don't starve yourself and go eat some good food on weekends!' Why am I angry? How can I not after telling her over and over again—not just for the past two weeks, Iris, but for my whole damn life—that I don't need her money and I know how to live? Why can't she just go treat herself better? Why does she never just register the meaning of the goddamn word 'no'? It's not just caring, Iris. It's fussiness and annoyance.</p><p>"As if I'm all heartless and I don't feel a thing when my mom tells me all grandma talks about is me, me, me or that I'm a pearl in her palm. But I hate her pampering—it nearly ruined me, and to be honest," he spat into the waves, "her deafness doesn't help with anything, either."</p><p>"'Hate' is a strong word…"</p><p>"Yet that's how I feel about it."</p><p>Iris found it hard to argue. She could see his point, thinking back to the moment before she left home. Grandma reminded her so much of an assistant caretaker working in her orphanage long ago—Camilia, who was caring to a fault. Were they well? Were they warm? They coughed—were they ill? Iris hid her annoyance by burying her face in books whenever Camilia was around, but even then, Cam would come over and ask about the book, smiling, did she like it, and finally, "you look a little pale, Iris, go into the forest for a bit of air." Why couldn't she just leave everyone alone like the other assistants? It wasn't until her sixteenth birthday before Iris had her answer. That night, Cam called her to her room and hugged her, saying, "You're a big girl now, Iris. I know you're tough, but every time I see how thin and small you are, I can't help but think that you're my own little sister and I have to take care of you." <em>Oh.</em> The detest she felt at the beginning of the embrace melted in revelation. <em>So</em> that <em>was why.</em> "I used to be an orphan, too," <em>No wonder she's so fussy,</em> Iris had thought. "and my matron was a really kind woman. She gave me this for my sixteenth birthday. You remind me a lot of myself, so… here. Not sure what other present to give you." The crystal amulet in the shape of a knot dangled around her neck ever since.</p><p>"How can you blame someone doing the only thing they can?" Iris didn't mean to say it aloud.</p><p>"Hm?"</p><p>"Um..." How to tell him what she thought of? He wouldn't listen, not now, when he was in one of his moods. Yet, she had to try. "Would you hate it if, decades later, I became… 'fussy', too?" She despised using such rhetoric. It was moral-kidnapping. <em>One got to slap herself in the face sometimes.</em> She thought. He didn't answer. She shifted her head on his shoulder, trying to find a comfortable spot. To her dismay, he was so thin that his shoulder blade cut through even the fabrics of his sweater and coat. "I know you won't change your mind so easily, but can you at least have a bit more patience with grandma, Billy? What else can she do with you away all this time? You rarely mentioned your family to anyone much, either." She didn't mean say it so bluntly. Billy snorted.</p><p>A group of tourists went by, scattering nuts and bread crumbs to the seagulls. The birds flocked pass, licked by the waves. The sound of the sea drowned the cries of… everything. Iris finally managed to get comfortable. She half closed her eyes and listened to the world: the wind, the sea, gulls, traffic, footsteps, and even Billy's breathing—all ebbed and flowed in unison. The world was a cradle, and the air a blanket, rocking her gently. She felt as if she was back at the Naren Star, then the Isle where the Academy was, and here simultaneously. How could this be? The sea exerted a magic so ancient that no one, regardless which parallel world they were from, could resist.</p><p>"You aren't staying here forever… and neither would grandma. You both know it." She breathed. "Forgive her and apologize, alright?" She raised her head. The light wintry sea wind swayed her hair and his cloak hem. He didn't speak for a long time.</p><p>"Better be lectured by you than my mom." Billy scowled again.</p><p>"Coming?" She smiled a little.</p><p>"No." He grunted.</p><p>"Well, come home early. Careful not to catch a cold." She kissed him and slid her arm out of his. She heard him go <em>tck</em>.</p><center>**</center><p><em>Well, I did what I could.</em> Iris thought as she pushed open the door.</p><p>"Where's he?" Mother asked from the kitchen.</p><p>"He's coming later. He wanted to check out a bookstore." She lied. "I wasn't interested."</p><p>"He'll die in a book pile." Mother said. "Forget about him—go wash your hands and let me teach you making dumplings. It's Winter Solstice today and that idiot of a son never got the hang of it." Grandma was folding the skin over the stuffing behind her. Iris felt a sudden enthusiasm and bounded over.</p><p>The lock clicked half an hour later and Billy stood in the door frame, hair messed by the wind and cloak tight around his body. Iris looked at him, smiling and egging him on. He glanced at her as though bracing himself.</p><p>"Grandma, I'm… sorry."</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The city looks adorable after snow, he thought, especially around Christmas. The yellow lights and grey wires were draped with tiny icicles from melted and refrozen snow. They ran along the street, above the Christmas shoppers' heads, through the bare branches of trees, swaying a little in the chilly December wind, and nodded at the other colorful lights—LCD and LED and neon—their brethren in the windows of various shops packed with customers. These merry lights raced each other on both sides of the street, curling into outlines of angels at each lamp posts, and converged into a big four-pointed star at a crossroad far ahead. "Hey Iris, look!" He pointed at the converge-point to the girl walking beside him, a leash with a golden retriever at its end in hand. Some designer apparently thought it a cute idea to hang also a wreath of mistletoe under the star, as if there would be anyone to stand under there. "Isn't that weird?" A faint smile played around the girl's pink lips.</p><a id="more"></a><p>"Hmm… you sound like you're from a parallel world, Billy." She jibed in a soft voice. "It reminds me of Naren Star all those years ago, when I lifted a mistletoe branch above me."</p><p>"We could go walk under there if you want, though I think any old mistletoe along the street would do." Billy laughed. It had been quite some years since they had been there. After everything had ended, he decided to leave, and passed everything onto a newer but no less able generation. It wasn't a binding position, and anyone can leave, as long as they keep their mouth shut about what they were. But few leaves—who would? A secret organization with good welfare was what anyone could dreamt for.</p><p>"Have I told you what Charlie did the other day?" Iris asked.</p><p>"When you took him to class?" When she nodded, he added, "Oh boy, I have a bad feeling about this."</p><p>"Right you are," she laughed and leant closer to avoid the incoming crowds with their bags, and stayed in that posture. It made both of them feel safe—the only time when they both let their guards down briefly. "Our cute dog soiled on the president's shoes…" Iris was talking quite animatedly, and as Billy looked at her, her laughter radiated from within, riding on waves of her unique quietness. Her long lashes quivered as her big bright eyes blinked, two shining jewels on a slim, pretty face, marble smooth. Quiet and shy never meant she wasn't energetic, as she was now. Her black hair that fell past her red scarf and shoulder danced around her long coat, the hem of which swayed in wake of her light steps, boots and jeans.</p><p>The street they walked down on wasn't full at all compared to the inside of the shops and some more major streets. Still, there were people doing Christmas shopping, stepping out of shops and breathing mist into the air, checking their lists to make sure no loved ones would not have a proper present. They chattered with their arms and hands full of bags, merry as birds flying in summer, getting excited over the deals they've just nailed. Then they saw Iris talking to Billy—men and women, guys and girls, old and young—they saw her there, beautiful and pure in her excitement, and their merriment became joy. They beamed at her, and she, still talking, imitating the president's awkwardness, smiled back at them in her quiet sweet way. This whole world loved her, and she this whole world.</p><p>"—and then—oh my, ha-ha—then Charlie just stood on his hind legs and licked his nose! You should see his face, Billy—I mean, right after Charlie licked his boots, oh my! It just cracked me up like that!"</p><p>"Ah I should've been there, for sure. Bad boy!" He let out a long chuckle and added to the dog, who lifted his head from sniffing a passing boot, an innocent look on his face. "The president is a good man, Charlie, we work for him, and he pays your doggie food." Charlie opened his jaws and squinted his eyes in a tongue lolling dog smile.</p><p>The sky was the usual December grey, and the wind had the same chill that always spoke of sadness after September. But the crowd and the music—Iris sang softly along with one of the tunes from a shop—was exploding festive cheer almost right in their face. It was a beautiful air, squeezing away the last of whatever negative emotions that was caused by the wind.</p><p>"Say…" Billy tilted his head, "it's Winter Solstice today… What shall I get you?"</p><p>"Huh?" Iris broke off in her singing. "Oh!"</p><p>"It's a big day for you back in your -"</p><p>"Nah, I'm all good; you are here, and that's all I –"</p><p>"How 'bout that bag you've always wanted?" He was getting excited. "Hey, or a portable heater? You always say it's cold walking from your office to the lecture hall—boy, haven't things changed, they make it really small and soft now –"</p><p>"It's all very good, young man, but what she really need is …" an old couple shuffled up and tapped his shoulder. "…a flower in her hair." As they watched, the old man took over the bags in his wife's hands and the old lady reached up to her white hair and pulled down her hairpin, which she handed to a bewildered Billy. "Put it in her hair," the old man said in a tender voice while the old lady smiled at Iris, who smiled back, "like what I did years ago. Put it into her hair for us, my dear, and Merry Christmas!" They walked on.</p><p>"Iris." Billy said.</p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p>"No. Iris." He jutted his chin at the hairpin, lips curved in faint wonder. On its black half-moon branch, carved out of wood, sat an iris blossom made of silk, blue and small, but vivid and full of energy, as though alive. "Well," they looked at each other. Charlie sat on the pavement, tail sweeping the snow, and watched them with anticipation, "coronation of Queen Iris at Yuletide!"</p><p>Amidst the merry Christmas-shoppers—puffing middle-aged husbands trying to catch up with their charging wives, young couples in their late teens and twenties leaning onto each other, trios of chattering girls, and little boys and girls dragging their parents to toy stores—she dipped her head and he reached out to stroke her hair and to clip the hairpin on.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>冬至悄悄来临，脚步轻盈。今天是一年中白天最短的一天，而我们所在的地方又更靠北一些，所以白天的时间变得弥足珍贵。</p><p>老纳尔早早就把艾瑞思和我叫了回来——简直是太早。</p><p>“大黑天没啥猎物可打，也没啥好玩的，我敢肯定你们领教过这儿天黑后的厉害。快进来啊，让我们像这里淳朴的北方居民那样来度过这个夜晚。他们有个老传统，冬至和圣诞节时，大家都围在炉火旁，每人捧着一杯热茶或热可可，一起讲故事、玩儿个尽兴。”</p><p>“像一家人一样。”艾瑞思接道。</p><p>“哎对，就像一家人一样。”纳尔点点头。</p><a id="more"></a><p>“那……今天讲啥？”我挤了下眼，问道。“勇气和荣誉的传说？备受敬仰者的历史？还是浪漫的爱情故事？”</p><p>“说实话，我今天不当讲故事的那个。我把位子让给你们俩。”纳尔笑了。</p><p>艾瑞思和我互相看了看，她思索片刻后开了口。</p><p>“嗯……毕竟是冬至啊……如果你们愿意听的话，那我就讲一个我在孤儿院听过的故事吧！这个故事来自我的世界，和你们的某个故事有冲突的话别怪我。”</p><p>“怎么会呢，来吧！”我哈哈笑着，有点等不及了。</p><center>**</center><p>“创世之初，资源非常有限。那是一段艰难、黑暗的日子，众神和人类一起挨饿。过少的蔬菜根本无法满足人类的需求，而人类自己也因身体羸弱，时常受到野兽的威胁。创世之后，众神都筋疲力尽了，神力的过度消耗使他们变得和人类一样虚弱。</p><p>“‘哦伟大的神啊，’人们向他们哭喊，‘我们要饿死了！你们可以不吃不喝，但我们这样下去一定会死的！求你们救救我们吧！’</p><p>“听到人们的哭诉，众神留下了眼泪。</p><p>“‘我们不能让他们经受这么多的苦难。’风对其他六个说。</p><p>“‘对，我们不能只管造人，却让他们饿死。’月说。</p><p>“‘但我们现在这么虚弱，根本不能造更多的植被给他们提供食物，也不可能打败野兽给他们肉啊！’土说。</p><p>“‘我可以把鱼儿唤到岸边，但那也远远不够。’水叹了口气。</p><p>“‘我倒是能帮助他们在夜里取暖，但至于吃的，我可什么也做不了。’火垂下了头。</p><p>“‘那我们只能向父神祈求帮助了。’星说。“他造就了我们，肯定不会抛下我们和我们可爱的生灵不管的。</p><p>“众神纷纷向父神祈祷。父神回答道：</p><p>“‘听吾言，记于心：汝等神力近尽，且末置人之事，使力甚微，体甚羸，不可搏于兽，其子弱然。来此，吾给以力，再以汝为媒，传之于人。于是，汝可耕粮葱葱，搏兽重重，垂鱼数数。世间也炉烟氤氲，人丁兴旺。’</p><p>“尽管这是个不错的想法，但众神已经筋疲力尽了。</p><p>“‘看上去我们积攒出的神力只能够我们其中的一个去完成这项任务。’土说。</p><p>“‘那我去好了，’太阳说，‘我会尽我所能。希望你们能为一个漫长的夜晚做好准备。’他带着其他神的神力登上了旅途。</p><p>“长夜到来了。</p><p>“‘我们来给他们光。’月和星说。于是她们一起创造了极光并赶走了人心里的恐惧。</p><p>“‘今晚我来给他们温暖。’火说。于是他为每一家生起了炉火。</p><p>“‘他们需要水。’水说。</p><p>“‘他们的水里也需要点东西。’土附和到。</p><p>“风把河流的声音传到了人们的耳朵里。他们跟随声音找到了河，灌满了水杯。在河边，他们看到了灌木。他们饿极了，摘下叶子放在杯子里，煮过之后一起喝下。世上第一批茶叶也不是很差。</p><p>“为了给人们做伴，留下的神召集起人类，陪他们坐在一起。然后他们给人们讲将要发生的事情。故事并不是那么吸引人，但在那时算是好的了。</p><p>“太阳终于带着从父神那里得到的神力回来了。人们立刻感觉强壮了起来。其他神也开始完善世界。但是，唉，旅途对于太阳来说太耗体力。他又变得虚弱，而且心事重重。这没逃过月姑娘的眼睛。她问他原因。</p><p>“‘唉，父神说凭我一人，我只能传递一年所需的力量！’’太阳答道。</p><p>“‘那我们就每年都走一趟。别忘了，你离开的时候我们在这儿也没让他们过得有多差。’</p><p>“太阳听了，心情好了起来。”</p><center>**</center><p>“所以每年的这个时候，太阳都要踏上为我们获取力量的旅途。他得加紧做白天的工作，所以此时白昼最短。在他回来后，他的力气每天都会恢复一点，他白天的工作时间也一起一点点增加。半年之后，他的力气又会渐渐减少，那个需要收集力量来踏上新的旅途的日子就又要到了。那一天对于人们来说总是无聊的，漫漫长夜也会非常冷。所以那一天，人们依旧保留着围在炉火旁，喝茶讲故事的习俗，就和这里一样。”艾瑞思讲完了。</p><p>老纳尔和我大笑，拍手叫好。</p><p>“一个和老头子讲的一样好的故事！”我叫道。“原来你们的冬至是这么来的啊！”我眨了下一只眼。</p><p>“嗯……我有几百年没听这么好的故事了。”纳尔梦一样叹了口气。“几百年没有啦。”</p><p>“我也好久没喝过这么好的茶了！”艾瑞思对她的茶杯甚是喜爱。我端起杯子喝了好大一口茶，刚要表示同意，忽然看到她在自己头顶举着一个圣诞花圈。</p><p>“你从哪——？”</p><p>“有人跟我说过这儿有个习俗是在圣诞期间在槲寄生底下的人可以得到一个吻呀。”艾瑞思顽皮地坏笑着。 纳尔开心地发出了精灵特有的笑声。</p><p>“哦我倒不介意在你脸上来一下！”他果然做了。</p><p>“我还在它下面呐~”艾瑞思继续唱歌一样说。</p><p>“纳尔，你下次讲的那个故事最好是讲这传统怎么来的！”我冲他撅了一下嘴。</p><p>举着槲寄生的那个姑娘笑的好可爱。</p>]]></content>

      <title>2014 Winter Solstice Story - The Story of Winter Solstice</title>
      <link href="/2019/12/23/2014%20Winter%20Solstice%20Story%20-%20The%20Story%20of%20Winter%20Solstice/"/>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Winter solstice came upon us in tiny cat's feet. This is the shortest day on Earth, and since we were so high up to the north, the daylight was especially scarce.</p><p>Old Nar' called Iris and me in early - much earlier.</p><p>“There is no good hunting or playing in the dark. I am sure you have experienced the harshness once the night falls. Come on in, and let us observe an old tradition the honest inhabitants here up north keep. We gather around the merry fire, and each grab a cup of tea. Then, we share stories and have a good time.”</p><p>“Just like a family.” Iris added.</p><p>“Aye, just like a family.” Nar' agreed.</p><a id="more"></a><p>“So, what's for today?” I asked with a wink. “Tales of valor and honor, lore of the reverend, or stories of romance?”</p><p>“Actually, I am not the teller today. I pass the rod to you two.” Nar' smiled.</p><p>Iris and I looked at each other. Then she spoke up after a brief thinking.</p><p>“Well... It <em>is</em> winter solstice after all... I'll tell a story I used to hear in the orphanage. A story from <em>my</em> world, if you will. Take no hard feelings, I beg, if it clashes with stories you have.”</p><p>“Why would we? Let's hear it then.” I laughed, eager for it.</p><center>**</center><p>“At the beginning of the world, the resources were scarce. It was a time of turmoil, of darkness, when the gods and the mortals starved together. Vegetables were not enough to feed the population; humans were weak and couldn’t best beasts. After creating the world, the gods were exhausted - so much that they’ve become, temporarily, weak as humans.</p><p>“‘O great gods,’ the humans cried to them, ‘We’re starving! Thou canst survive without food and nutrition, but we, without them, will surely die! Save us, we beseech thee!’</p><p>“Hearing this, the gods wept.</p><p>“‘We cannot allow them to suffer,’ said Wind to the other six.</p><p>“‘Nay, we did not create them so they die of hunger,’ said Moon.</p><p>“‘But weak as we are now, we cannot even create more vegetation for food, nor best beasts for meat!’ Earth said.</p><p>“‘I can summon fish to shore, but it still will not be enough.’ sighed Water.</p><p>“‘Of heat and warmth in the night, I can help a great deal. Of food, nothing I can do.’ Fire hung his head.</p><p>“‘Then we pray to the Great One for help.’ said Star. ‘It created us, and will not forsake us, or our lovely creations.’</p><p>“Pray they did, and the Great One said thus,</p><p>“‘Hear me and hearken onto the words: thou hast depleted thy energy, and it is the cause of the weakness of thy subjects, for thou created them last, and hast no more to pass onto them. Of this they cannot best the beasts, nor can they bear good fruits. Cometh to me, and I will restore thy strength, and the strength of thy subjects through thee. With this, you can create more vegetation for food, best beasts for meat, and create more fish for nutrition. The fire will cackle merrier and the humans will grow in numbers, and prosper.’</p><p>“Good though the promise was, the gods, as said, were exhausted.</p><p>“‘It seems we can only gather enough energy that is needed for one of us.’ Earth observed.</p><p>“‘Then I will go,’ Sun said, ‘fast as I can, and entrust thee to prepare for a long night.’ And he gathered the energy of the other gods and embarked on the Journey.</p><p>“A long night fell.</p><p>“‘We will shine light for them.’ said Moon and Star. And together they created aurora and chased away the fear from human hearts.</p><p>“‘I will keep them warm in this night.’ Fire said, and kindled fire in human homes.</p><p>“‘They need water to drink.’ Water remarked.</p><p>“‘They need something for the water, too.’ Earth followed.</p><p>“Wind passed the sound of rivers into the ears of humans. They followed the sound and filled their cups. Beside the banks, they beheld bushes. They were starving, and pulled off the leaves and them into the cups. They boiled them and gulped down the contents. And the first tea was not distasteful.</p><p>“To keep them company, the remaining gods gathered the humans and sat with them, and they told them what was going to happen. It was not an enthralling story, but it passed, at the time, as a good one.</p><p>“Sun finally returned, with energy and strength from the Great One. Slowly the humans felt stronger, and the other gods began to perfect the world. But alas, the Journey had proved to be too much for the Sun. He was weak again. Something else seemed to bother him as well. Lady Moon was observant, and inquired the cause.</p><p>“‘Why, the Great One said I can only transfer enough energy for a year!’ was Sun’s reply.</p><p>“‘Then we will do this every year. Mind you, we did not have such a terrible time here.’</p><p>“The Sun was content with that.”</p><center>**</center><p>“So, every year at this time, the Sun needs to embark on the Journey to obtain energy for us. He has to hurry during his day duty, making the day the shortest. And after he’s back, he gains back his strength day by day, and the time he can take his duty increases along with that. Half a year later, his energy will wan again, and the time would come for him to gather up the energy of the gods for another trip. It was always boring then for the humans, and the long night cold. So when the time comes, people keep the practice of gathering around the fire and share stories with tea, much like the tradition here.” Iris finished.</p><p>Old Nar’ and I smiled and clapped.</p><p>“A story fine as the old timer’s!” I exclaimed. "So that’s how winter solstice comes about in your world!" I winked.</p><p>“Aye... I have not enjoyed a story more for centuries.” Nar’ sighed dreamily. “Could not enjoyed it more.”</p><p>“And I certainly enjoyed this tea!” Iris smiled at her cup fondly. I took a draught from mine, was about to say something in agreement, when I saw her holding a wreath over her head.</p><p>“Where—?”</p><p>“Someone told me that it’s a tradition to kiss whoever is under the mistletoe during Christmas.” Iris grinned mischievously. Nar’ laughed his cheery elven laugh.</p><p>“Oh I do not mind giving you a peck on the cheek!” And he did.</p><p>“I’m still under it ~” Iris continued in a sing-along voice.</p><p>“Nar’, your next story’d better be about how <em>this</em> tradition come along!” I made a pout at him, and drew near to the girl holding mistletoe over her head.</p>]]></content>

      <title>A Brief Guide to Alvar</title>
      <link href="/2019/01/30/A%20Brief%20Guide%20to%20Alvar/"/>
      <url>/2019/01/30/A%20Brief%20Guide%20to%20Alvar/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="General-Introduction"><a href="#General-Introduction" class="headerlink" title="General Introduction"></a>General Introduction</h2><p>The town of Alvar is located in Noble County in the U.S. state of Ohio, 360 kilometers west of the Appalachian Mountains in the North American continent and 120 kilometers south of the Lake Erie. The closest city, Bennon, is 20 kilometers to the north. Alvar is a municipal town governed by a town council, and its population was 427 at the 2020 census.</p><a id="more"></a><h2 id="Geography-and-Town-Layout"><a href="#Geography-and-Town-Layout" class="headerlink" title="Geography and Town Layout"></a>Geography and Town Layout</h2><img src="/2019/01/30/A%20Brief%20Guide%20to%20Alvar/Alvar%20Map2.jpg" class="" title="Location of Alvar"><img src="/2019/01/30/A%20Brief%20Guide%20to%20Alvar/Alvar%20Map.jpg" class="" title="Alvar Street Map"><p>Alvar has a total area of 1.8 square kilometers, with its land measuring 1.6 square kilometers and its waters (Alvar Pond) measuring 0.2 square kilometers. The town is situated on the northern slope of Alvar Hill and measures 1 kilometer from north to south and 1.6 kilometers east to west. Its Main Street starts from 1 kilometer north of the northern town edge and ends at the southern edge of the town, where the forest covering the Alvar Hill begins and also where the slope becomes steeper. Alvar Hill has a height of 86 meters and an altitude of 200 meters. Lying at its foot in the south is Alvar Pond with an average depth of 20 meters. The pond contains mostly trout. The island at its center measures 16,000 square meters. The forest on Alvar Hill consists a mixture of pine and deciduous trees. It spans a further kilometer south of the hill, surrounding the pond and providing a hunting ground of 300 acres. However, the forest south of Alvar Hill does not fall under Alvar’s management.</p><p>In Alvar, the words “street” and “road” carry specific meanings when referred to the layout of the town. “Streets” run only in the north-south direction and are straight. The “roads” run in the east-west direction and are usually curved or even serpentine depending on the geography of the hill. The Main Street and the Avenue Road are the central street and road, respectively. Main Street divides Alvar into its East and West districts. Other streets are named by the district they are located in, followed by their distance from the Main Street, eg. East 1st Street, West 9th Street, etc. The roads in Alvar are named in series, such as “the Seasons” (Spring Road, Summer Road, Autumn Road, and Winter Road) and “the Gardens” (Rose Road, Shamrock Road, Orchid Road, and Lily Road). Because of the gradual slope, each road is higher than the one north of it. Roads and streets in Alvar tend to be narrow, only wide enough for two cars to pass through side by side. The sidewalks are 1 meter wide with no public lawns, and some streets and roads do not have sidewalks. All trees and lawns are in the household gardens.</p><h2 id="Demographics"><a href="#Demographics" class="headerlink" title="Demographics"></a>Demographics</h2><p>As of 2020 census, Alvar had a population of 427, 156 households, and 129 families. The population density was 267 people per square kilometer. The racial makeup of the town was 79.1% White, 1.0% African American, 1.3% Hispanic or Latinx, 9.1% Native American, 0.8% Asian, 8.7% from two or more races, and 0.08% from other races. 98.0% of the White populations were of Irish descent.</p><p>The median age in Alvar was 56. 8.0% of residents were under the age of 18; 11.7% were between the ages of 18 and 24; 15.7% were between 25 and 44; 30.1% were from 45 to 64; 34.5% were over the age of 65. The gender ratio of male to female was 636:655, 48.9% male and 51.1% female.</p><p>A total of 107 crimes were documented from 2011 to 2020, of which 93 were physical assaults in the form of bar brawl; 19 were domestic violence, and 7 were motor vehicle theft.</p><h2 id="History"><a href="#History" class="headerlink" title="History"></a>History</h2><p>The area surrounding Alvar Hills was used as part of the hunting grounds for Shawnee Indians until the arrival of 17 Scotch-Irish immigrants led by Aulon Weir in the spring of 1744. Weir allegedly purchased Alvar Hill and its surrounding areas with “a year’s supply of brandy and four barrels of gunpowder along with twenty muskets.” Academics held a skeptical view toward this account for a long time: in 2008, local historian Beatrice McNeal unearthed a Shawnee settlement site a mile west of Alvar, along with 34 charred bodies of various ages dating back to 1700s. The remain of a male body of Irish origin in the center of the explosion suggested that “Alvar was built on lies and blood,” as Dr. McNeal wrote later. The diary of Aulon Weir’s wife, Moira Weir, which was also rediscovered in the Alvar Library in 2008, helped historians confirm Dr. McNeal’s speculation.</p><p>It is widely accepted today that Weir and his company crossed the Appalachian Mountains on March 4, 1744, and settled at the foot of Alvar Hill on on March 11. On March 21, Shawnees returned to the village west of Alvar Hill and hunters discovered Weir’s settlement. The peaceful negotiation for the ownership of the territory lasted for a week and a payment of a year’s supply of brandy and 20 muskets was settled upon for the land up to “a thousand yard [0.944 km] north from the foot of the Hill, totaling 200 acres [0.81 sq km].” The exchange was peacefully made on March 28. On April 3, 1744, Weir wished to make an additional purchase for the hill and the pond at its south. The Shawnee requested four barrels of gunpowder as payment, but only for the right of use. Weir bartered 8 barrels for the ownership, but was rejected. On April 5, 1744, Finnegan Weir, brother of Aulon Weir, entered the Shawnee village to accept the price for usage rights. As the entire village gathered as witnesses, Finnegan Weir revealed his real intent. He pulled out his pair of reading glass before he read the contract, but instead of putting them on, he focused sunlight through them onto the open barrels of gunpowder. Aulon Weir led 5 men after the explosion into the burning village and shot the survivors and the wounded.</p><p>In 1784, Alvar, along with the Ohio Country, became part of the Northwest Territory according to the Treaty of Paris. In 1803, Alvar came under the governance of the newly accepted State of Ohio as part of Washington County, and later became part of Noble County at its establishment in 1851, keeping its municipality and its designation as a “town” (as opposed to the “village” defined in the Ohio Constitution) as part of negotiation by Brendan Weir, the Chair of the Town Council of Alvar and son of Aulon Weir.</p><p>By the 1900s Alvar was well-known as a slow-paced Irish residential town and largely overlooked by outsiders. It wasn’t until the rise of Bennon as a center of education and culture before Alvar came into the public’s (however slight) attention. Due to its proximity to the city and the University of Ohio, Bennon Campus, and its cheap housing rates, a handful of working people moved into the town since 1918. Because of its reputation as an all-Irish settlement, only three African American and five Native American residents were recorded in the 1980 census. With the expansion of the Bennon campus in 1963, Alvar enjoyed a further in-rush of residents with a noticeable increase of people of color.</p><p>On July 4, 1989, a two-people brawl outside the town’s tavern, Shamrock and Eagle, escalated into a six-people shooting gunfight involving three African American college students and three locals of Irish descent. Four were shot dead, and one was heavily wounded and died later in the emergency room. The only survivor, McCoy Lowry, claimed that the initial argument started with his friend Connor Kelleher challenging an African American student’s claims of “American identity”. The 1989 Alvar Tavern Shooting reduced its African American and Native American population by 80%; it has been on the rise again from 2001, and stabilized in 2017. The Asian population also increased slightly, as other villages around Bennon had deeper histories with Asian communities.</p><p>In 2018, <em>Forbes</em> noted that Alvar had the lowest crime rate in the country. A state-wide survey in 2020 found that Alvar had the highest average age in Ohio. Another survey also found that Alvar is popularly known as “that tucked-away village” by the 3% of the Ohio population that were aware of its existence.</p><h2 id="Culture"><a href="#Culture" class="headerlink" title="Culture"></a>Culture</h2><h3 id="Government"><a href="#Government" class="headerlink" title="Government"></a>Government</h3><p>Alvar is governed via a Town Council. The council consists of seven members:</p><ul><li>Chair of the Council</li><li>Chair of Business and Finance<ul><li>Regulation of business ownership and the treasurer</li></ul></li><li>Chair of Communications and Public Relations<ul><li>public relationship with other villages, cities, etc. and oversees media</li></ul></li><li>Chair of Development<ul><li>oversees town development and environmental concerns</li></ul></li><li>Chair of Education and Entertainment<ul><li>in charge of kindergarten and elementary school concerns in Alvar as well as event planning for holidays and festivals</li></ul></li><li>Chair of Jurisdictions (The Grand Judge)<ul><li>oversees the court and town’s rules and regulations</li></ul></li><li>Chair of Public Health and Safety<ul><li>clinics, hospital, and home safety, also the Alvar police force and fire department</li></ul></li></ul><p>Theoretically all seven council members are of equal importance. In practice Chair of the Council is akin to the mayor and more often than not serves as the public spokesperson; Chair of Communications and Public Relations became more or less a minor role in the council in “public relations”. In recent years, however, the Chair of Communications and Public Relations has been making more appearances in public and engaging with nearby villages and city of Bennon officials, promoting more exposure for Alvar.</p><p>All council members are elected to a five-year term by the entire town; only current residents with four or more years of continuous residency in Alvar are eligible to run and be elected for a council position, and only current residents with six or more months of continuous residency in Alvar are allowed to vote.</p><p>While the council makes administrative and legislative decisions of the town, the Committee serves as the bridge between the town residents and the council. It consists of 8 members, each representing two “sectors” (the strip of blocks within two adjacent streets) during committee meetings. Due to the importance and the length of the Main Street, the representation of sectors between East 1st Street and West 1st Street is an exception, as they are represented by two committee members.</p><p>Committee members communicate with residents and business-owners of their respective sectors, passing along important policy drafts and open voting sessions to each block from the council, and issues raised by residents to the council. Committee members are nominated by the residents of the sectors, and are voted upon every two years by both the council and the residents from the sector, who have over three months’ of Alvar residency.</p><p>All members of the council and the Committee are subjected to the “Antidic Rule” (“anti”-“dictation”), which states that, as a collective, Alvar residents have the power to sack immediately any council or Committee member involved in, but not limited to, crime, dictatorship, ill management, or poor health, as long as the threshold of petition is met or exceeded. For council members, the threshold is 45% of the entire Alvar population, regardless of term of residency; for Committee members, the threshold is 25% of the population in the sector represented by the member in question. The “Antidic Rule” was established after the sacking of Aulon Weir and has not invoked since.</p><p>All voting requires proof of legal status in the United States and a minimum age of 14. All positions in the council and the Committee require proof of legal citizenship or permanent residency in the United States, as well as an age of 30 or above.</p><p>Council meetings are held weekly, and the last meeting of every month is open to public in the meeting hall in the Town Hall. Committee meetings with the council are held bi-weekly, and are open to public at all times in the Courthouse.</p><p>Though Alvar has high municipality, the State of Ohio withholds the ultimate right of governance.</p><h3 id="Lifestyle"><a href="#Lifestyle" class="headerlink" title="Lifestyle"></a>Lifestyle</h3><p>Alvarians enjoy a slow-paced and relaxed lifestyle.</p><p>On weekdays, Alvarians commute to work in Bennon mostly by light rail that runs every 15 minutes. Cars, while used, are uncommon because of the lack of easy-to-travel by-roads onto the highway. In the evening, the townspeople either stay at home or visit the local tavern, Shamrock and Eagle. Bedtime is generally 10 p.m. On weekends, Alvarians are accustomed to sleeping in, starting their day after 10 a.m.</p><p>Local business hours run from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. on weekdays and 10:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. on weekends. Due the nature of their business, breakfast cafés run from 7 a.m. to 11 a.m. daily, the tavern opens from 5 p.m. to 11 p.m. from Sunday to Thursday and 5 p.m. to 1 a.m. on weekends, and the tavern-affiliated inn opens from 7 a.m. to midnight, but has personnel at the front desk 24/7.</p><p>Though the Alvarians live up to the hot-tempered (and drunk) Irish stereotype, they are generally open, hospitable, and eager to help. It is an unwritten rule to provide shelter to travelers at night when requested. This is not without precaution, however: everyone is trained in self-defense martial arts from elementary school to middle school since 1939. Residents from outside are also required to participate in a month-long self-defense program when they settle in. In more recent times, travelers to the town are required to present a valid ID that is to be recorded by police night patrols before being taken in. However, this has been rare with the expansion of the town’s inn in 2001.</p><p>Alvarians enjoy gardening and outdoor activities such as hiking, fishing, and hunting. The forest south of Alvar Hill is a popular hunting spot for the townspeople, and Alvar Pond is likewise for trout-fishing. Children in Alvar engage in the parkour tradition from the age of five.</p><h3 id="Landmarks"><a href="#Landmarks" class="headerlink" title="Landmarks"></a>Landmarks</h3><h4 id="The-Olde-Square"><a href="#The-Olde-Square" class="headerlink" title="The Olde Square"></a>The Olde Square</h4><p>The Olde Square is located at the east end of Avenue Road. Three buildings enclose the 2025 square meters of granite-paved clearing: on the south side is the Courthouse; at the east end is the Town Hall; bordering the north side is the Town Archives and Library, which was also the old Alvar church. Although the square and its buildings have undergone three major renovations and restorations in 1844, 1950, and 2011, they retained their rustic and simple style. The 1844 renovation witnessed the fall of Aulon Weir’s statue, and the erection of a sundial in its place. In 1950, the Olde Square’s buildings, along with the rest of Alvar, embraced electricity. This brought about the total renovation of the buildings on the Olde Square to their current looks. The wooden structures were mostly replaced by blocks of granite, the Town Hall was expanded eastwards and a story upwards (totaling two), and the Alvar Church was re-purposed into a full library and archives. Today only the entrance way of the Town Hall remains in its original 1744 wooden construction, together with its thatched roof that is replaced every decade.</p><h4 id="The-Hospital-of-Alvar"><a href="#The-Hospital-of-Alvar" class="headerlink" title="The Hospital of Alvar"></a>The Hospital of Alvar</h4><p>The Hospital of Alvar complex takes up the entire block bordered by four streets and roads; in the clockwise direction, they are: West 2nd Street, Autumn Road, West 1st Street, and Spring Road. The precursor of the complex was the town clinic of Alvar. Built in 1746, the log cabin was renovated into a stone cabin in 1790, and was further expanded in 1840 to accommodate runaway slaves who wandered off the usual Underground Railroad routes. The clinic was later incorporated as a station for slaves en route to Sandusky or Cleveland, and was frequented because of its rather isolated location and the fierceness of the locals against slave catchers. The clinic grew in size during this time as a station and became the Hospital of Alvar in 1856. By the end of the Civil War, the Hospital of Alvar had assisted a total of 534 slaves on their bid for freedom.</p><p>Today the original clinic still stands and opens to Spring Road. It serves both as an urgent care in its east wing and a memorial museum of Alvar’s only involvement in the Civil War in its west wing.</p><h4 id="The-Observatory-Tower"><a href="#The-Observatory-Tower" class="headerlink" title="The Observatory Tower"></a>The Observatory Tower</h4><img src="/2019/01/30/A%20Brief%20Guide%20to%20Alvar/Alvar%20Observatory.jpg" class="" title="The Alvar Observatory"><p>The most prominent structure in Alvar, both in terms of its physical appearance and its mystery, is the observatory tower. Standing 15 meters atop Alvar Hill and measuring 10 meters in diameter, the cylindrical marble tower is wrapped with ivies on the exterior wall and capped by a matte silver metallic dome. The base of the dome is covered by a band of sapphire a meter in width and 30 centimeters in thickness.</p><p>Little about the observatory’s origin can be found in the town records. The earliest mention of the observatory comes from Aulon Weir. On March 30, 1744, Weir wrote in his diary,</p><blockquote><p>The Tower! Such a Structure on the Hill, Walls crawling with dried-up Ivies all around and cracking here and there. Its Windows were the clearest I have ever seen—Finn banged his Head on it when he tried to poke it in and have a Look around. It did not even crack; I swear by God that Finn has the thickest and hardest Head around, and the Ivies shook when he made Contact. Nay, not a hairline Crack. Through the Windows we saw Shelves, all empty. There seemed to be a Statue in there, but the inside was not well-lit despite the windows; we could only see halfway in. Facing the North is a set of Steps leading up to a Gate of black Metal. We saw no Keys nor Keyholes nor any other Mechanisms to open it. Took my trusty Pickaxe to it and bloody Hell, nearly broke my Arms and definitely my Pick. It crumbled against the Gate. Asked the Indians about the Tower. Got their usual Fudge about Gods walking the Earth and peering into the Heavens to return Home. PISH!</p></blockquote><p>On April 1, 1744, Weir wrote again in his diary of the observatory, though briefly,</p><blockquote><p>Some bloody fucking Joke this is. Got a Mallet out of Granite made from the Smithy, and mulled the Window of that blasted Tower. The Mallet <strong><em>shattered</em></strong>. Took the Musket right up against it, and the Barrel exploded like somebody stuffed it. I be the Fool the day I decided to go in. Finn was still obsessed. Fucking Blockhead, should not have listened to him in the first place.</p></blockquote><p>The Alvarian fascination with the observatory lasted only until Aulon Weir’s death in 1783. The mysterious observatory was ignored and avoided for the best part of 120 years until, in 1910, a small group of four historians led by René Luce took an interest in the tower. However, without a way to enter the structure, Luce was only able to record measurements of the exterior and photograph through the windows.</p><p>Luce’s group was closely related to the Alvarian myth that the observatory tower was cursed. On August 13, 1910, the owner of the local inn and tavern, Shamrock and Eagle, found that Luce and his group had disappeared overnight. All of their luggage were left behind except for the black Oxford briefcase Luce always carried around. Nobody reported seeing them leave, and a combing through their belongings by the police found a curious absence of materials related to the observatory. The rumor that the group was “cursed and spirited away” because of their involvement with the observatory tower started spreading and prevailed up to this day, even though it was personally debunked by René Luce and the publication of his 1912 paper on the observatory, <em>La tour curieuse du passé: sur l’Observatoire d’Alvar</em>. Luce’s own account of the “disappearance” was simple. His group was on their last round of photography excursion at the observatory on the night of August 12 when the American photographer Thomas Brown emerged from the woods south of the observatory, and they struck up a conversation. Eventually Brown became intrigued by Luce’s group’s camera. Brown helped Luce and his group take photographs of the observatory, and the latter followed Brown further south to investigate “an Indian ruin [Brown] passed on the way here”. It became the beginning of another investigation of an unknown “trail of tears”. Luce’s group never had an opportunity to return to Alvar for their belongings due to the intensity of their investigation before they had to return to France. “It was lucky that we had our passports and wallets on us at all times when we go on international excursions.” Luce later commented. “We later had our stuff shipped back to us. Cost a fortune, but nothing’s lost.”</p><p>The myth kept people away from the observatory until 2003, when the Alvar-born historian Beatrice McNeal led her team of two historians, one mathematician, one engineer, and one linguist to study the observatory for her doctoral dissertation. McNeal gained entrance of the observatory by reverse-engineering the black gate using ultrasonic and X-ray equipment. The engineer, Buck Hoffmann, disabled the locking mechanism with electromagnetic methods and fixed a mechanical lock and door handle to the gate for future entries. Through radiocarbon dating of the wooden furniture, McNeal estimated the age of the observatory to be 4,000 years old. In 2013 McNeal further assessed the observatory’s age with luminescence dating. She concluded an age of 4,200 years in her 2014 paper.</p><img src="/2019/01/30/A%20Brief%20Guide%20to%20Alvar/Alvar%20Observatory%20rendered.jpg" class="" title="Model of Alvar Observatory as rendered by Dr. Beatrice McNeal"><p>McNeal described the observatory to have three floors: the subfloor, the atrium, and the observatory dome.</p><p>The subfloor is a round library hall measuring 24 meters in diameter and 5 meters in height. It houses 230 redwood bookcases, each with five 40-centimeter tall shelves. It is unknown how the trees or the shelves were transported to the site. The bookcases measure 1.2 meters wide and 30 centimeters deep. Two hundreds of them are arranged into four square sections, five in each row. Two two-meter wide aisle perpendicular to each other separate the four sections. The rest 30 bookcases are lined around the wall with redwood desks and chairs. Two rows of lamp run along the wall at the height of 1.5 meters and 3 meters off the floor, respectively. At the center, where the two aisles cross each other, is an intriguing machine on a three-tiered marble base. The machine resembles a modern computer case attached to a dentist’s chair and a lectern. The casing of the processor tower is made of matte black metal. X-ray failed to penetrate its thick shell. Above the chair is an obsidian half-dome, reaching down from a thick, matte casing that extended from the back of the chair. The lectern is placed under a rod. There is neither an apparent booting method nor any signs of a power source. Directly above the machine is an orb around 1 meter in diameter hanging down from the ceiling, held in place by three interlinked chains. The orb seems to be made of smoky crystal, and disperses light around the subfloor when shone upon. On the wall to the south is another black gate. The gate is arched at the top, measuring two meters wide and three meters tall. Patterns are engraved on its surface, originating from a ring pattern 2 meters above the floor, splitting into two main paths, branching and curving their ways downward into the ground. Dr. McNeal failed to reverse engineer the gate, as it is impregnable by X-ray or ultrasound.</p><p>The atrium on the first floor is dim despite the tall and wide windows along the wall. Each window sits 50 centimeters above the ground, towering 3 meters high and ranging from 2 meters to 4 meters wide. Once unlatched, the windows can be either pushed open or slid into the gaps between the double-layered tower wall. When pushed open, the window panes can refract light into the interior and brighten up the room considerably. The exterior and the interior wall layers are 70 centimeters and 20 centimeters thick, respectively. X-ray analysis revealed a curious structural design in the ten-centimeter gap between the exterior and interior walls: slabs of additional marble are placed in the gaps to form intersecting channels throughout. Dr. McNeal speculates that these structures served as pipes that are absent: had the observatory a heating or a cooling system, the air or water could move through the wall for high regulation efficiency.</p><p>The first floor also contains bookshelves, lamps, and desks like the subfloor library. The statue in the center that was observed in Weir’s diary is pristine and accumulated no dust to date. It is intricately sculpted out of white marble, depicting a long-haired young king with sharp features and rather pointed ears hidden beneath the sculpted hair. Its eyes are set with sapphire. The writing on the base it stands on bears a plaque, and the writing upon is fiery and indecipherable. A map of parchment, 2 meters by 2 meters, hangs on the southeast section of the wall near the stairs up. It is annotated in the fiery writing as well as showing unfamiliar landscapes. Scholars debated its authenticity, some comparing it to the <em>Voynich Manuscript</em> while others claimed it merely shows an older landscape of the local area, pointing to a section recognized by many as the Alvar Pond, citing its larger area, its different southern shoreline, and the depiction of a river that now runs underground.</p><p>The second floor is the observatory dome, 10 meters in height from the floor to the apex of the silver dome. On the west section of the wall is a set of steps leading to a platform 2.5 meters wide and 2 meters above the floor. Below it are four more bookcases. The platform runs for 3 meters along the wall, its edge marked with crystal panels set in rails.  At its end are more curious machines with metal casings like the one in the subfloor library, but these have smaller processing cases. Columns raising from the processing cases support several sloped control panels with buttons, switches, and levers presumably to control the telescope. An obsidian slab is raised behind the control panels as though a screen. Again, as with the machine in the subfloor library, the control apparatus cannot be activated or scanned for interior design.</p><p>The telescope in the center of the room is supported by a mobile, circular base. The base has six granite wheels around its circumference, all one-meter in diameter, double-layered, and 25 centimeters thick per layer, a total of 60 centimeters thick. The wheels run in 62-centimeter wide grooves in the floor, presumably in both directions to rotate the telescope. The base of the telescope has a diameter of 3 meters. The lens of the telescope is 5 meters long with a pitching angle from 20&deg; to 70&deg;. The eyepiece is 10 centimeters in diameter and the objective is 1.2 meters. X-ray unraveled a complex diffraction and reflection mechanism within the lens, which provides a calculated focal length of 20 meters. Another black metal box was discovered in the column supporting the lens with filaments resembling wires connecting it to the objective lens. Combined with hairline filaments crisscrossing the objective lens, it is speculated that the telescope is able to perform imaging through mechanisms other than mere optical imaging.</p><p>A set of steps on the east side of the base lead up to the stone seat in front of the eyepiece. A small obsidian slab raises up and forward from the right armrest of the seat. The slab’s position is adjustable.</p><p>There are also 12 granite wheels along the base of the dome. These wheels run on track rails, and are also double-layered, but with a longer axle compared to the wheels of the telescope. Each axle connects the outer double wheel and the inner double wheel. The bottom of the dome has grooves for the axles to settle in. The sapphire band outside bends backward at its top and fits into the gap between the layers of the outer wheel, locking itself securely with the dome and alleviates the mechanical stress the band might be under; with the protruding tracks the outer wheel runs on, the sapphire band also locks the wheels into place, which secures, in turn, the dome. The wheels can rotate the dome in both directions.</p><p>The wall of the second floor bears 9 smaller windows, 1.5 meters tall and 1 meter wide, making the hall even more dim than the floor below. However, all of these windows can be moved like those in the atrium, and bring in light from outside to great effect. Additionally, several movable slabs of metal on the dome seem to serve as windows when more daylight is needed. These can be pushed open quite easily, as long as one is able to reach them; however, situated at least 7 meters off the ground, it will be no small task. A larger slab of metal that acts as the skylight for the telescope is also on the dome. No powered mechanisms of control of any kind was found. Historians and researchers have not succeeded in operating the telescope, or any part of the observatory, except for the front gate.</p><p>In addition to the power source, despite the total 240 bookcases found in the tower, not a single scroll, tome, book, or text collections or information containers of any known kind was found other than the plaque on the statue and the map. The materials found so far are insufficient to reveal concrete information of the observatory’s origin. Due to its unique design and lack of reliable historical records, no realistic theory is proposed publicly on the subject. Dr. McNeal, the historian most involved in the research of the observatory, commented,</p><blockquote><p>“The joke within our circle, of course, is that the tower was built aliens stranded on Earth to find a way home. Believe or not, this joke is more readily accepted than the theory saying it’s a practical joke by the Weir Family. Looking at the aesthetic style of the tower, the outlandish design of the mechanisms of the door and the telescope, the advanced and, seriously, <em>alien</em> technology, ya’ know, involved in the entire building process, and the fact that the tower has no power source found yet everything within demands a power source to function—oh not to mention that Indian myth Weir reported in his diary—it is too hard <em>not</em> to think of extra-terrestrials, ya’ know? Oh, have I mentioned that my linguist friend on my team told us that the language system on the map and the plaque is <em>nothing</em> like any language we have on Earth, be it natural or artificial? But it bares unmistakable signs of a natural language, ya’ know? Of course, no—I’m more inclined to the theory that a more technologically advanced ancient civilization built this. <em>That</em> is probably the most logical answer here. Too bad I’m not allowed to dig under my town for more, ya’ know? Too bad there are talks in the council about razing this thing down for a highway by-road. They’ve want a proper road to Highway 77 for ages, ya’ know, more convenient access to Bennon. Of course I could just throw the ancient civ theory out at them, but if <em>you</em> are the decision-makers, would <em>you</em> buy it?”</p></blockquote><h3 id="Architecture"><a href="#Architecture" class="headerlink" title="Architecture"></a>Architecture</h3><p>The first Alvarian houses were log cabins with traditional Irish thatched roof because of a lack of stone resource in the area. Later the entire town of Alvar underwent two large-scale renovations: one in 1844, shortly after the installment of the first steam-powered railway system; another in 1950, with the introduction of affordable electricity.</p><p>The 1844 renovation was a facelift for Alvar. The newly built train station and the railway connected Alvar with the then-growing village of Bennon, providing more robust commercial trade with the outside world. The railway also brought in aesthetics and practices prevalent of the time. Soon the modernization began, first with architecture. Stone blocks for construction were imported for the first time, through the railway. The traditional sharp-angled thatched roof and hemp-tied log cabins were replaced by the more fireproof, tiled roofs and stone walls. The fire pits in the center of each log cabin evolved into stone fireplaces in the back of the living room. The dirt roads became paved. The town was also able to expand and established the convention of “streets” and “roads”.</p><p>The 1950 renovation brought Alvar more up-to-date systems, such as electricity, tap water system, proper drainage, town-wide heating system, and updates to the architecture that remain to this day. All new systems run underground, including electricity and telephone cables, and the later optical fibers.</p><p>Houses in Alvar today are built of stone bricks and are painted gray, white, or yellow. The houses are traditionally low, with no elevated front porches, and no more than two stories high. The first story is dug into the ground; upon entering the front door, there will always be two steps down. The houses have basements but no attics. Each house has either one or two chimneys. Since 1950, the roofs are covered in thicker black or red tiles than the ones used in 1844, and are striated with ridges that can guide rainwater to either side. The slope of the roofs also became much more flat in the 1950 renovation, angling between 15&deg; to 20&deg; downward. Roofs cover not only the second story but also the protruding first story in the front and back, as well as the side without a chimney, giving the houses a tiered appearance. The lower roofs generally extends 1 meter from the wall, and the upper roofs are much shorter, usually 15 to 20 centimeters. Gardens are surrounded with low walls 1 meter tall and 30 centimeters wide, leaving a gap for the entrance way. The size of the houses and the gardens vary from household to household, but because of the road layout, the backyards are generally a less-than-one-meter wide strip half covered by the lower roof.</p><p>One unique structure of Alvarian architecture that can be seen frequently in the town is the roof bridges. First conceived during the 1844 renovation and became more and more widely accepted after 1950, the roof bridges connect the second stories of the two houses on the opposite sides of a street of a road. These bridges are 2 meters wide and are supported by a long arch. Roofs of both houses extend to cover the bridge. In the case which the two roofs are not in the same color, usually the tile color of the bridge is a mix of the two depending on the two households.</p><p>The roof bridges were intended as emergency escape routes. At either end of the bridge is a fireproof door that the house owners have keys to. The corridor has two windows on either side of the wall, and a trapdoor in the ceiling in the middle of the bridge. Each roof bridge is equipped with heavy-duty rope ladders under the low interior windowsills, in addition to fire extinguishers, bulletproof vests, tear spray, and emergency hammers. In emergencies residents can escape through windows onto the ground or the trapdoor onto the roof if needed. All roof bridges and their equipment are checked twice every year by the fire department.</p><p>Roof bridges are considered a defining symbol of Alvar. There are 70 roof bridges in total, and most of them are within East and West 3rd Streets, but a handful of them can also be seen in the more recent expansions of the town outside the two streets.</p><h3 id="Parkour"><a href="#Parkour" class="headerlink" title="Parkour"></a>Parkour</h3><p>Visitors of Alvar, be it tourists or hunters seeking a quiet fishing or hunting spot in fall, or hikers emerging from the trails in the Alvar Woods, or students of the University attracted by low rents, never fail to be astonished by the sight of children sprinting and leaping on top of the houses when they first arrive in Alvar. If they asked a child where he or she hang out in free time, the answer would always be, “the roof tops!” as it has been for the past eight decades. Thus is the one-of-a-kind underage parkour culture in Alvar, thanks to the town’s landscape and layout. </p><p>Unlike the world outside, parkour activities are limited only to children in Alvar. What is more, the activity is sanctioned, and even encouraged. Children of Alvar are characteristically agile, and start parkour as early as at the age of five. Young children learn the activity through older children. The first steps begin with climbing onto the low garden walls and learning how to balance, and followed by running and skipping on the lower roofs. At the age of six the children can climb onto the lower roofs by leaping from the side or the back garden wall. An average eight-year-old Alvarian child is able to freerun around the roofs in his or her block and, with the help of roof bridges, perhaps those in the neighboring blocks. A ten-year-old can freerun throughout the town.</p><p>The usual route of parkour starts with scaling up to the lower roof either by leaping and grabbing from the side or the back garden wall or from the second-floor windows. From here, the lower roofs provide a runway along the road (interspersed with garden walls and trees). The upper roofs are reached only by scaling the walls. From the upper roof, the child can reach the lower roof of the adjacent house south by jumping down; ambitious children are able to do so via the lower roofs as well, thanks to the close height difference and the gap between the two lower roofs. Because of the distance and height, roads and streets are crossed only via the roof bridges, or at the end of the roads where roofs are closer together. Very rarely a child can be seen to cross via strong trees. This stunt often ends in a trip to the urgent care.</p><p>It is unclear how the culture started or why it is pertained to children. The first evidence of this activity was from a travel log in the early 1950s, and scholars believed that the sturdier structures and the ridged tiles brought about by the 1950 renovation paved the way for the beginning of this tradition. Anthropologist Trevor Murphy, an Alvar local himself, agrees to this view and points out that photographs of Alvar by Thomas Brown, who returned to Alvar multiple times in his life up to his death in 1968, provide indirect support. In photographs from 1946, the roof tops are still bare. In a photograph from 1954, however, a group of young men and women above twenty can be seen leaning against a chimney while two children run across a roof bridge. Brown was known to be particularly fond of the photograph of a young woman leaping over a gap to the roof he was standing on, taken from the same period. Murphy also found mentions of parkour activity in diaries of grownups at the time. These mentions, however, ceased after 1960. A later collaboration paper between McNeal and Murphy in 2011 contained an economical explanation to this phenomenon. The roofs can support a combined weight of no more than three adults before the tiles break. This means that prolonged running and leaping activities from adults will wear down the tiles faster, causing a sizable amount of repair cost. Children, on the other hand, will cause much less damage because of their size, especially when taken into account that children of Alvar are rarely overweight because of their lifestyle. Indeed, in 1959, the year of the state-wide flood in Ohio, repair cost for the roofs dropped by 85%, merely because the majority of the adult population in Alvar spent an entire year joining the post-flood reconstruction efforts in the nearby village, Howard, and did not engage in parkour activities. The continuously low roof repair costs seems to indicate that the adults dropped the activity since then. Murphy further commented in the paper,  </p><blockquote><p>From my own personal experiences, most of the children parkoured less and less at the age of 15. It is no coincidence, I think, that this is also the age at which they prepare for high schools. Alvar itself no longer has a local high school, and children have to attend out of town. A lot of their choices are boarding schools as well, and some children, like I was, come home only once a month. This, together with the increased schoolwork, cut down the time they can parkour. As their teenage bodies mature, they realize themselves as well that if they continue to parkour, they will not only be putting their safety at risk, but also that of the roofs.</p></blockquote><p>As for the concerns of safety, both McNeal and Murphy suggest that it is minor. In their survey for the 2011 paper, 96% of adults local to Alvar (both born in the town and residents of over five years) reported that they would worry more if their children does <em>not</em> join in the parkour culture. Top concerns for this include potential health issues (the child might have ailments preventing him or her from freerunning or he or she might not get enough exercise) and bullying behavior (the child might be bullied by others or he or she might be unpopular). This, however, does not mean safety is not on the minds of the parents, as their paper stated,  </p><blockquote><p>The initiation to the activity is always done by the parents. A common exchange between young children around five is, “did your ma/pa put you on the wall yet?” The phrase “put on the wall” means the initiation, in which the parent puts the child onto the garden wall, letting the child walk along while holding his or her hands, and helping the child find the way down. During the first weeks, the parents will repeatedly recite safety rules to the child before he or she gets on the wall: “Always watch your steps; never parkour after sundown; never make a jump without complete confidence; never jump down from upper roofs; never run over streets or roads when cars are driving past; never run across the Main Street; never cross streets or roads from trees.” Peer supervision also adds another layer of safety. Children stopping each other from dangerous stunts are uncommon but also not rare. The town also imposes a ban on parkour after 5 p.m. all year long. Police night patrol will be out at this time, and will ask children to get down. To our knowledge there is yet to be a case of disobedience.</p></blockquote><p>Occasionally deaths and injuries will occur. There is a total of 22 injuries and one death from 2010 to 2020.</p>]]></content>
