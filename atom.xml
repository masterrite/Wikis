    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>“We certainly weren’t <em>this</em> loud when we were freshmen.” Lily glances around the cafeteria. Wading through the chattering crowd with an empty stomach, only to find a rather cramped table for four in a corner is <em>not</em> her ideal first day of senior year in middle school. Her friends nod in agreement. “I wish it’s still summer.”</p><p>“Definitely not ready for school, no.” Julia pulls an extra chair over.</p><p>“No kidding.” Landon comes over with a slice of cheese cake, four cupcakes, and two big chunks of brownie. He hands on brownie to Max and tries to stuff the other into Julia’s mouth, and gives the cupcake plate to Lily and Mae. “I guess especially you, Mae, since you missed most of it in the Treasure Trove.”</p><a id="more"></a><p>Mae thanks him and nods. The Treasure Trove is the bookstore not far from Mae’s house, where her mother, Catherine Murray, works. Over the summer Mae worked there part time as well. It’s one of the few things she managed to persuade her mother.</p><p>“I heard Mr. Mackenzie like having you there.” Max says. Mr. Mackenzie is the balding owner of the Treasure Trove. “He doesn’t say it in front of Cate, but he tells us you’re the shop’s mascot.”</p><p>“Duh. Mae’s smile can melt snow. I’d have her as a mascot, too, if I were him.” Julia rolls her eyes.</p><p>Landon asks through a mouthful of casserole,</p><p>“Why are you working there again?”</p><p>“Make some money. Help out mom after… you know…” Mae’s face gets redder by the second, “…dad got in jail after a bar fight back in April.”</p><p>“Oh right. Sorry.” Landon jerks as Julia kicks him under the table.</p><p>“No, it’s fine. It’s quiet with him gone. Working around books is nice, too. See, I’ve been thinking,” Mae taps her small chin with the handle of her fork, “I shall buy mom something… a present – with my first pay.”</p><p>“Good idea.” Max agrees.</p><p>Around them the clamor reaches its apex as students from all three grade years dig in. Freshmen argue loudly over contents from their morning classes, bragging about the little they know of the material on the last few pages of their textbooks: Plato and the Cave, Einstein and the wave-particle theory, genes and TALONS, etc. The Sophomores snigger behind their backs, throwing fugitive glances at the little know-it-alls. The seniors like Mae and her friends are too tired already to care a thing about what’s going on around them. “Why are they treating us like high school students?” They groan. “It’s not like I want to enroll in the high school department <em>here</em>.”</p><p>“…hmm… Dad’s out in November… I think I should get him something as well…” Mae absentmindedly sucks on the tips of her fork.</p><p>“What?” All four of her friends round on her.</p><p>“Just - nothing.” Mae bends down to her salad.</p><p>“So soon?” Landon and Julia ask in unison.</p><p>“What are you getting him?” Max asks.</p><p>“Hold on a moment,” Lily frowns. “Why?”</p><p>“Why not?” Mae mumbles.</p><p>Mae’s father, Richard Murray, is the town of Alvar’s infamous alcoholic. Large and menacing, he fell down the water hole ever since his first factory went bankrupt ten years ago. His fall from a respectable factory manager to a despicable peasant at another factory (in his own words) was just a little too hard, it seems. It takes the stars to align for the small town of Alvar to see him sober for a month straight. His alcohol-fueled rages have even earned him a ban from the local tavern: the story goes that Bart the Bartender had to threaten him out at musket-point. He ended up seeking booze in Bennon, the nearest city, and as of April, the last bar he visited banned him, too, after he wreaked havoc inside over an argument. He went to jail. The bar went under renovation. Neither is over, yet.</p><p>Even without alcohol he has an ugly reputation. It’s no secret about the domestic violence in the Murray household. The neighbors are all too familiar with the cries of Catherine and Mae, as well as the sound of materials breaking: porcelain, glass, wood, metal, and even bricks in the wall. Mae used to have bruises and wounds on her arms and legs that she’d brush off with a lie, and nowadays she covers them up under sleeves and long pants or dress. Catherine is said to have shown up once in the clinic with a broken wrist and a swollen eye. The doctors aren’t fooled by her “took a fall” talk, but they can’t do anything except tending the wounds. Cate’s left eye never healed to what it was before.</p><p>No one in town can do anything about it: no one can get concrete evidence of his abuse. Sure, maybe Mae is underage and susceptible to threats and fear and keeps her silence, but Catherine Murray – is it religious fervor or simply Stockholm Syndrome? – never admits it, either. No one understood why, when Mae’s grandfather Ryan Murray came into town three years ago with a cricket bat after been tipped off about his son and chased Richard Murray through the streets, determined to beat him into a pulp for what he did, it was Catherine who threw her arms before the broken man to plead her father-in-law to have mercy.</p><p>The best the Alvarians can do, and did, is to ensure that Richard Murray never gets his hands on a gun. The police confiscated his hunting rifle years ago, and make excuses to search him whenever they meet him in the streets.</p><p>Mae is kind, and Lily knows that better than anyone; but to endure years of abuse and still gift her abuser is inconceivable to her. She opens her mouth and can’t find the words to shut it.</p><p>“He… isn’t really a good dad, is he?” Julia doesn’t like the idea of being nice to Richard Murray, either. She tries to relieve the awkwardness.</p><p>“He never gave <em>you</em> any presents, right?” Compared to offending Mae, Landon right now is more worried about Lily blowing up into one of her own frenzies. He has only seen it once: she was as silent before the outburst then as she is now, and that once was enough for a lifetime.</p><p>“We just want your first income go to people who really deserve it.” Max is earnest as always.</p><p>“I –” Lily starts, and immediately the other three tries to stop her,</p><p>“Lily!”</p><p>“– want to hear what you think, that’s all.” She finishes.</p><p>“He’s my dad. I won’t be alive has it not been for him.” Mae mumbles again.</p><p>Landon, Julia, and Max look from Mae to Lily to Mae and to each other, all thinking that one day Mae might <em>just</em> be alive has it not been for her father. They wait for Lily’s response, anxious. All she says softly is,</p><p>“I’m sorry.”</p><center>**</center><p>It’s the Saturday before Richard Murray’s release. Mae’s grandparents accompany her to the Bennon Mall. It’s only the first day of November, and the banners hanging from the metal frames of the huge arching skylight overhead are already prophesying the discounts and deals to come. Shoppers are everywhere. Children drag their parents into toy shops and candy stores that dot the length of the hall. Young couples and teenagers dance in and out of fashion stores. Families of two or three or more crowd the walkway or aggregate around benches. Even the bookstore looks smaller from the outside with all the people. <em>Everyone wants to start early with the Thanksgiving shopping.</em> Mae says to herself and can hardly hear her own voice in her head, so she says it over and over again.</p><p>This is her first time in the mall without the Liu’s. However much Lily’s parents insist that she is as good as part of the family, Mae can never fully push through the invisible wall in her mind. She feels herself ungrateful and cruel. It’s strange today, walking through the crowd, not with them and conflicting with herself but having her own burly Grandfather Ryan in the front making the way and her own plump Grandmother Diane beside her offering an arm. Under the canopy of banners blaring “THANKSGIVING WARM-UP SALE” and “5% OFF IN C<strong><strong>* K</strong></strong>“, Mae thinks that perhaps this is what shopping with her own mother might be in another world. If she was the type she might even pine at her mother or grandmother for some pretty coat or a pair of shoes in the display window. Bottom line: Mae doesn’t have to avoid looking at other families in the mall anymore.</p><p>“Great Scott, what a blasphemy. Where’s the Christmas songs already!” Grandma Diane says in Mae’s ear. “Remember, back in ‘94, you listen to Christmas songs on November 1st.”</p><p>“Oh shucks, old girl,” Grandpa Ryan turns around and walks backwards, “‘94! <em>‘94</em> - on our first date in <em>‘64</em> they played Carla Thomas before Halloween –”</p><p>“Don’t listen to him, dear.” Grandma Diane tugs Mae close and says in a carrying whisper, “We were <em>not</em> dating when we were six.”</p><p>“Psh! Come over to gramps, Mae, and tell us, anyone you fancy back in Alvar –”</p><p>“Be a gent and go on make way for the ladies, you!” Grandma Diane waves her hand.</p><p>Embarrassed, Mae blushes. She is always scared of conflicts, and shies away even from minor disagreements. But she doesn’t mind the old couple bickering somehow. It isn’t like her father yelling drunkenly at her mother, rather, more like Landon and Julia - it’s cute. Perhaps this is what her friends will be like in 50 years. <em>And hopefully not with a granddaughter abused by their son.</em> She thinks.</p><p>The cloud passes by the sun in the azure sky outside, and they come to a fashion store.</p><p>“Really?” Mae peers questioningly into the interior. In the brightly-lit space, a sea of shelves and racks bearing clothes in the style of, deeper and deeper in, casual, business-casual, business, sports, and undergarments.</p><p>“Of course. We buy our own clothes here.” Grandpa Ryan says.</p><p>“Old soot has quite an eye for fashion still.” Grandma Diane pats Mae’s arm.</p><p>Mae has to agree. The store is packed with mostly young people too hip for her to look at. They are joyous and loud, moving their limbs in exaggerated ways – the sort of people that one might see in fashion commercials. So <em>this</em> is where they get to look the part.</p><p>“We’ll get Charlie’s with Ryan’s. They wear the same size – you, my dear, we ought to get you something, too.” Grandma Diane nods.</p><p>“What - no, you don’t have to –”</p><p>“It’s our call here, dear.”</p><p>“But I don’t know how –”</p><p>“Pick whatever you fancy. Your mother has some weird ideas about ‘daily attires’, as she says. Not that she doesn’t about other things –” Grandpa Ryan says.</p><p>“Ryan!” Grandma snaps.</p><p>“Anyways, pick something that’s not gray or ‘austere’. Off you go. We’ll be over there.”</p><p><em>Grandpa doesn’t like mom much, huh.</em> Mae thinks as she browses the racks and models. <em>How did mom even get married to dad?</em> She realizes that she knows almost nothing about her parents: what they were like as children, how they met, and how her father came to be who he is today. Maybe he used to be one of the rowdy teens in the crowd behind her, cracking jokes with his friends and girlfriend; or maybe he was like Max, quiet and honest and caring until some incident flipped him around –</p><p><em>Oh no, impossible. Max is nothing like him.</em> Mae frowns at the clothes. Almost every one of them looks too fashionable, and Mae has trouble imagining herself in them. Julia would fit right in for all of them, and Lily might be slightly pickier about what she puts on, but her? Eh. Poncho coats? Retro denim jacket? Leather bomber jacket? Suede coat complete with matching cashmere scarf and hat?</p><p>“Can I help you?” A store assistant bounces over. Mae’s face goes red at her bust.</p><p>“Oh, um –” Maybe she should just refuse. “I’m wondering if you have –” What should she get? “ – any coats –” Yes, a coat is suitable. <em>Pfft, “suit”-able. A coat suits.</em> She grins, embarrassed. “ – that are more – “ Mae swallows the words, “for me”. “ – I mean, <em>less</em>, um… bright?” <em>Phew.</em></p><p>“Less bright? I think a bright color would match your hair great! No? Well, if you insist…” The girl picks out a few coats with darker shades. Mae looks around for her grandparents. They catch her eyes and wink. <em>Okay then.</em> She sighs.</p><center>**</center><p>The best type of clothes her mother likes is the type with no decorations at all: she herself wears plain white blouse and gray dresses. The only difference between different seasons is the length of the sleeves and the thickness of the fabric. If she was at home she might also change to loose sweatpants. The most decorative clothes she (and Mae) owns are blouses with lace at seams and collar, looking like straight out of an 1800s painting. The burgundy long coat with a shoulder cape as collars that Mae chose should stand well with her: the most decorative pieces on there are the double columns of brass buttons. Mae likes its vintage-yet-updated design and the color. When she tried it on, it was a slim-fit yet not hindering her movements. The shop assistant said she had an eye for it, and Mae decided to give her the benefit of doubt. <em>It’s warm, anyways. Mom won’t talk.</em></p><p>As for her father… What will he be wearing when he comes back on Thursday? Will her clothes fit?</p><p>“Are the seats taken?” The mischievous voice is one that Mae knows well. She whisks her head up from her food and sure enough, finds herself beaming at Lily’s father. Beside him are Lily’s smiling mother and the grinning Lily herself.</p><p>“Not for you.” Grandpa Ryan laughs and pats the seats. “Sit down already!”</p><p>“I didn’t think we’d meet you here!” Lily hugs Mae as Lily’s mother and Grandma Diane greet each other warmly. “Shopping, too? Wait, is it about the presents you talked about two months ago? What did you get?” Mae shows her.</p><p>“Sweater and thick pants for Richard. Hmm, they ought to keep him warm.” Lily’s father says.</p><p>“Picked them out herself.” Grandpa Ryan puffs out his chest.</p><p>“A bookbinding kit for Catherine?” Lily’s mother leans over.</p><p>“Picked it out herself.” Grandpa Ryan puffs out his chest again.</p><p>“I was surprised how much she knew about those crafting kits.” Grandma Diane says.</p><p>“Mom taught me.” Mae says simply.</p><p>“Anything for yourself?” Lily asks.</p><p>“Well… there’s the coat, but gramps and gran paid for it –”</p><p>“Picked it out herself!” Grandpa Ryan puffs out his chest for the third time.</p><p>“Say something else, idiot!” Grandma Diane slaps his shoulder. “You still have some money left, don’t you, dear? Go get yourself something.”</p><p><em>Buy myself something with my own money… That’s sounds so alien.</em> She thinks. It must be the possessive, <em>her own</em> money. She can’t deny it’s a good idea, though: the final cherry on the top for that feeling of accomplishment. Besides, everything she bought so far weren’t too expensive. There <em>is</em> plenty money to spare.</p><p>She already has a new coat, though. What else should she get?</p><p>“Yeah… maybe a teddy bear for a change…”</p><p>“Or you can get your first phone with me.” Lily suggests.</p><p><em>A phone, huh.</em></p><p>“If you do, we can switch to a family plan together.” Says Grandpa Ryan. “Like, <em>finally</em>. You know how much our current plan costs, Diane?”</p><p>“We should make you two her emergency contact if Mae goes for the phone. We might be too late when we get to her all the way from Bennon.” Grandma Diane says.</p><p>“Certainly.” Lily’s mother nods.</p><p><em>A phone, huh.</em> Mae considers this. Her own phone… it’d be much easier to call her grandparents if she gets one, and to contact Lily and her parents as well, if issues (<em>Dad,</em> she corrects herself) arise. Max has a phone, too… she can get his number. She smiles and nods. What’s to worry about – it’s <em>her</em> money. Besides, they’re a quarter way in to the 21st century, and she’ll be 14 next month. It’s time she joins the modern world and starts to leave her mother’s old one.</p><p><em>Exciting.</em>  </p><center>**</center><p>The door is ripped open and slammed shut on Thursday evening, and Mae jumps so hard that she almost drops the plate she’s washing. Trying her best to suppress the trembling of her legs, she turns halfway around to watch the hallway outside the kitchen. <em>There goes peace and quiet.</em> She sighs. <em>How should I give him the clothes?</em> Part of her says that she doesn’t want to, and that her friends were right to object in the first place.</p><p>There’s a “thud” as her father kicks off a boot, and is followed by huffing and low growling. <em>If it’s an effort to kick off one boot, then he’s too drunk already.</em> Indeed it doesn’t take ten seconds for the sour stench of alcohol to waft past Mae. What did she expect, really? That her father would repent in jail? That the jail would make him a new man? That her life would become a better one? Of course he would come home and leave for booze hunt right after finding his car key, if she has to guess. After another loud thud, Richard Murray stomped his way down the hall. Mae braces herself.</p><p>Little by little Richard Murray emerges from the behind the kitchen door frame out of the dim hallway. First is his flat and straight forehead plastered with his furiously red hair roughed by wind and sweat and melted snow. Then comes the heavy and uncouth face, screwed up as he concentrated on putting one foot before the other. So what if they shaved him before his release? Whiskey and vodka put them right back onto his double chin and square jaws in one mere hour. There’s a new bleeding scar next to his huge nose standing out against his old ones. Who shattered under his fists tonight?</p><p>“Welcome home, dad.”</p><p>His head swivels on his thick neck between his slouching shoulder and in he staggers. <em>Oh no, oh no.</em> Mae holds the plate and the sponge close. Richard Murray throws out an arm and shovels her aside. Mae hits the fridge and slides into the corner between it and the wall, ignorant of the soap water she squeezed out of the sponge in reflex. The reek off of her father is making her sick.</p><p>“Damn place ain’t got a mirror now?” He growls.</p><p><em>This isn’t the bathroom. Go away. Go away.</em> Mae thinks. <em>Go away already!</em></p><p>“Fucking snow. Ice everywhere. Slips. Damn fuck.” He rubs his scar looking at his reflection in the window pane. “WHY AIN’T THIS SHIT WORKING!” He strikes the window. It cracks into a spiderweb.</p><p><em>Go away. Go away. Thank god mom had it changed to laminated glass since last time. Go away already…</em></p><p>Mae’s prayer might as well as works. Her father stumbles around and out of the kitchen without looking at her. <em>Thank god all I got was a shove.</em> She goes shakily back to the sink and opens the other, uncracked window. The night air rushes in and Mae shivers. Between the cold and her father’s reek, she’d rather freeze.</p><p>“CATHERINE!” goes Richard Murray on the second floor. His footsteps moves closer and closer overhead. “Won’t even come out and greet me after six months? The Lius grew you guts, eh?”</p><p>“No, I’m sor –”. There’s a slap from directly overhead and her mother breaks off. Mae freezes.</p><p>“I’ll get them tomorrow! ALL of them!” Her father howls. “From that wimp to his wife to his cheeky little girl –” He rants and slurs and Mae considers shutting the window. This is no longer a choice between the stench and cold air, now.</p><p><em>Maybe having the neighbors hear him would help us.</em> She slides it close. <em>But then there’s mom.</em></p><p>“– for six months I had nothing!” and there’s a violent “thump”. Mae hears her mother squeal and the bed springs groan. She knows too well what’s happening upstairs. She feels sick. The running water helps little blocking the sounds, and very soon she finds herself locking her bedroom door, glad it’s on the first floor at the opposite end of the house.</p><p>On a chair next to her desk is the bundle of sweater and pants she wrapped the evening before. Perhaps she should just throw them away, or give them to her grandfather: someone, like Max said, who deserves it. </p><p>In the distance come her mother’s faint moan. Mae flips open the book she borrowed and tries to read. Keats usually pulls her in instantly, but not today: two layers of doors and a layer of floor can’t stop her ears from picking up the faintest of those sounds that she almost grew up with. Her mother never resists, always trying her best to live up to the “good wife” model she worships. “It’s our duty to make our husbands happy.” She said. But does she really believes in it? Lily’s mother never says that, and Lily’s father doesn’t drink like a fish, either. They are both happy. <em>But do they also–?</em> Mae screws her eyes shut, ashamed of the thought. <em>No, stop it. What am I thinking?</em> Then she can’t help but adds, <em>Where else would Lily come from… But even if they do, it’s not like dad with mom.</em> She can now hear her father cursing at her mother. It’s emanating from the wall itself. Mae pushes <em>Keats</em> away and runs to the bathroom to wash. When she finally dries herself and curls up in bed, she still feels dirty.</p><p>Should she call someone? It’s still not too late. Her grandparents, at least, are awake. Or perhaps Lily, or even Max. What should she say? </p><p><em>I’m scared.</em></p><p>Of what?</p><p><em>My dad.</em></p><p>Why? </p><p><em>…</em></p><p>Julia is a better person to talk to, but she doesn’t have a phone, nor Landon, who lives next to her.</p><p><em>I really needn’t buy that, huh. Nothing can improve my life one bit.</em> Mae covers her ears with her pillow. <em>Should’ve went with the teddy bear.</em></p><center>**</center><p>The train pulls into Alvar Station at 5 o’clock the next day. The clouds in the grey sky look almost touching the tree tops. To the south, outside the station, the layers of roofs along the Alvar Hill are capped in snow. Mae busies herself with redoing her bun in front of a window, pulling it apart and rewrapping it, her teeth clenched tight. Landon’s face appears behind hers in the reflection.</p><p>“You’ll be pulling your hair out.”</p><p>“Don’t want to take chances.” Mae’s scalp screams at the pull but she doesn’t care. Her mother found her left the dishes from last night half-done this morning and wasn’t happy. With her father now home, she’d better make sure nothing ticks either of them off.</p><p>Julia catches up and winces at the last snap of the elastic band. She loosens her own ponytail in reflex.</p><p>“I know your mom is strict with your hair, but isn’t that too much? You’ve already redid it before we left.” She says. Mae looks at her own feet out of habit and shakes her head. “Oh right… your dad’s back.”</p><p>Mae nods and turns to leave the station.</p><p>“So… how was it last night? Did you give your dad his present?” Landon asks.</p><p>“Don’t want to talk about last night.” Mae mutters to the ground. Landon frowns, troubled. Julia wraps an arm around her.</p><p>“Talking might help you feel better. It worked before.”</p><p>Mae looks up into Julia’s clear, blue eyes with her green ones. Last night she wanted to do anything to tell Julia what was happening, and now she can’t bring herself to it. Perhaps it has to do with Landon be present. Perhaps it has to do with her realization that nobody can help her. Her bun feels heavy and she hangs her head again. Julia stops. She turns Mae around.</p><p>“Was it that bad?” She asks, worried. Mae nods. “Then come home with me for the night - I’ll convince my parents; or go to Lily’s place when they come back, if you want to.”</p><p>“Yeah, I think that’s a good idea, you stay with Julia or Lily.” Landon echoes. “Like, out of sight, out of mind. Or you can come with me. I don’t might sleeping on the couch.”</p><p>“I can’t always run away.” Mae says in a small voice. “And I can’t go anywhere unless dad’s away in the city.”</p><p>Julia makes a face. Lily would drag Mae home without a second thought. Her family accommodates Mae and her mother often whenever Richard Murray goes out for drinks at night – ever since her father was banned from Shamrock and Eagle – to help them avoid him when he come home drunk, so it’s much easier for them to stay there. Max, always considerate, would be a big help right now, too: Mae likes Max. She’d consider his words, at least. It’s unfortunate that they are coming with their parents at the university today, and Julia would rather not manhandle her friend. It irritates her that she can’t do anything to help, and she doesn’t like how downcast Mae look. Sighing, she gathers Mae into her arms, muttering, “Oh you, poor little bird, you…”</p><p>“I’ll be fine.” </p><p>Julia raises her eyebrows and pushes the corners of Mae’s mouth up with her fingers. She has never seen such helpless and dim eyes above smiling lips. Then Mae blinks and breaks into a smile on her own. She shakes herself lose from Julia.</p><p>“Well, that works. A bit.” Landon says from aside.</p><p>“Thanks. I shall be going now.” Mae waves and turns.</p><p>“Call us if you need us, okay?” Julia shouts after her. “Any of us! Or our parents! Keep your phone with you, okay?”</p><p>Mae nods to the ground and heads uphill in quick steps. She probably ticked Julia off with her little rebellion, since she usually follows along her advice, sometimes pretending to follow to not make her feel bad. Not this time: words alone can’t change the reality, and neither can her mother nor her. <em>Why didn’t he just die in a fight or something.</em> Mae is startled by her own thought. <em>No, no… don’t think like that…</em></p><p>She turns onto Shamrock Road and one block later the road opens up to the Main Street. Down to her left, blocks away, are the train tracks crossing over the road that curves out of sight and connects eventually to the highway to Bennon. Up on her right is the rest of the town, layers and layers of tiered, flat rooftops, their red or black tiles poking out of the fresh snow caps from last night, paving higher and higher uphill until it meets the dark-green forest. At the hilltop, Mae can make out the white-capped dome of the Alvar Observatory. Dots of light blink on throughout the hillside, from streetlamps and windows. It’s always a sight for Mae: it’s as though the stars themselves have descended upon the town in the falling darkness, transforming it into the Fairyland. It looks cozy in the frigid air. Mae is convinced that it’s the snow-laden Alvar in the evenings that’s on so many Christmas cards out there.</p><p><em>Had there only a clear sky.</em></p><p>Everything - the houses, the cars, the people, the very town - is ready for the night. The heavy sky presses the wintry wind down and grinds it on the town like a useless sponge scrubbing the snow. “Forlorn”, that’s the word that comes into Mae’s mind as she surveys the town through a natural gray filter.</p><p>A school bus roars down Main Street, and Mae wonders briefly what it feels like to come home on that, instead of the train – what does it feel like to have a normal “home” to come back to at all? Would it be that far from packing up to go to Lily’s house for the night with her mother? She’s happy when she’s with them, happy and safe, knowing that they won’t be woken up by her father’s drunken noises or be used as his rage-vent, even though she can’t look past the fact that she’s not part of Lily’s family – she doesn’t look like them, after all; she’s nothing like them – or that she’s still more reserved around her mother and can’t act naturally, to be “herself”.</p><p><em>Home, huh. What does it even mean?</em> Mae crosses Main Street. She picks her way through unshoveled snow and thick sheets of ice. <em>A familiar place with familiar people? A safe and happy place to return to or even, hide in?</em> She nods her greeting to the plump wife of Bart the Bartender, who’s walking her granddaughter home from grocery shopping. <em>Was that what Ruth was sick for, as Keats wrote, standing in the cornfield?</em> Those plants can grow up to six feet or even more, way taller than what Ruth could be, and they’re yet to be seen on the coast of the Mediterranean in her era. Standing in the dark maze of alien plant, sick for a familiar, safe haven – <em>Keats’ brilliant.</em> – yes, that suffocation and hopelessness, Mae knows too well.</p><center>**</center><p>Her phone vibrates when Mae is almost home. It’s from Max.</p><p><em>Didn’t get to ask today - is everything alright at home, with your dad back and everything?</em></p><p>It brings a small smile on her face. She should’ve gotten <em>him</em> something instead.</p><p><em>It’ll be fine. I’m</em></p><p>She hesitates before continuing,</p><p><em>home. Chat later.</em></p><p>Her mother’s portrait of the Virgin greets her as usual. Whoever drew it must’ve tried to make her blind: her eyes are those of the dead, looking past her long nose above the small puckered mouth without a purpose or a focus. What’s <em>she</em> so sad about, anyways - giving birth to the God’s son must’ve been all woman’s dream in her time. Mae avoids her gaze and hangs up her coat.</p><p>Catherine is in the kitchen preparing dinner, in her gray cotton dress and looking more dour than usual.</p><p>“Mom, I’m back.”</p><p>“You’re a bit late.” Her mother doesn’t sound angry.</p><p>“I’m sorry.” Mae knows better.</p><p>“Wash your hands and come help.”</p><p>“Yes, mom.”</p><p>Does her mother really love her? Her mother did look up when she called out. On rare occasions in which Mae cuts herself while chopping, Catherine would always treat her immediately, and not without tenderness. When she was little Mae even considered injuring herself on purpose just to experience that care. <em>Is it really out of love, or is it her ‘being a good wife’ nonsense?</em></p><p>In the living room, her father sits spreadeagled on the couch watching TV with a scowl. Mae stands at the entrance way, about to take off her shoes and greet him before she registers what he’s wearing.</p><p>The new sweater and the pants fit him well.</p><p>He turns his head and their eyes meet, bloodshot green on clear green. One thing Mae has learned in her life is that she should never get her hopes up, but for one split second, as she half-bowed to untie her shoelaces, she is deluded with a vision of her father giving her a gruff “thanks”. She almost smiles when she realizes that the clothes should be in a package in her room, and her mother never knew about it being wrapped or placed thus. What was he searching her room for?</p><p>“So.” Richard Murray growls. Mae straightened up. “So.”</p><p>“Hi dad, I’m back.” Mae says automatically.</p><p>“Grew wings, eh?” Richard Murray sneers. “Making money like a big girl now, eh?” He stands up and advances, eyes narrowed. Mae trembles. “I get in for six months and already you’re making a life without me, eh, setting up your own little bank and everything?” Mae has to clench her teeth to stop them from clattering. In the kitchen, the sound of her mother’s chopping stops.  She takes a step back. “Where’s the rest of your money?” He demands. “Hand them over!” He’s drunk. The stink is faint but he’s definitely drunk. “NOW!” Mae backs off and her father presses on. “<em>DIDN’T YOU HEAR ME?</em>“</p><p>The kitchen light is thrown upon his menacing and scarred face, and Lily’s face blooms into Mae’s mind. Richard Murray lurches for her. Crash goes her bag onto the floor as she turns to run, slipping through his fingers and out of the front door.</p><p>The chilly air seeps into her clothes. She should’ve grabbed her coat. The darkness is falling fast and it’s becoming difficult to see the ice patches. Mae dares not run too slow; she does her best keeping to the snow and away from the more slippery ice. When her father is out of the door she is already at the block junction of 2nd Street and Shamrock Road. Did her mother try to stop him, or was he too drunk to turn the handle? If he was, then he might slip on the ice – It almost feels as though the sidewalk is pulled from under her. She falls and bangs her knee on the metal fence around the neighboring house. Mae scrambles to get up and the very next second she feels the steel toes of her father’s hunting boots connect with her thigh. The kick sends her sliding across the junction.</p><p>She is picked up by her hair the next moment and receives a sound slap, then another, and a third. They reverberated in the air and leave her ears ringing. There’s nothing she can see other than her father’s heavy face. She tries to stand: her scalp feels like tearing off her skull.</p><p>“<em>This’ll</em> teach you!” Richard Murray snarls. “<em>This</em> is for your damned bank! <em>This</em> for your bitchy clothes. <em>This</em> –”</p><p>“No, dad - stop! Please!” Mae sobs, reaching up to release her hair.</p><p>“<em>Give me the money!</em>“ Richard Murray screams and punches her. Mae feels like the impact ripped a muscle in her neck. She flies out of her father’s hand, collides with the cobblestone wall beside them, and lands head-first onto the sidewalk. A car skids to a halt and a man gets off, yelling,</p><p>“What’s going on here? Stop what you’re doing!”</p><p>“Help! Help me, please – ah!” Mae watches her father punch the man in the face, who bounces off his own car and slides down.</p><p>Mae has to get up and get away. Blood trickles down her face and pain flares across her forehead, her thigh, and her knee. She manages to raise. Richard Murray makes to follow, then turns to kick the man from the car off of his leg. He spots his daughter staggering across the road and strides over.</p><p>“Someone stops Richard Murray! Anyone!” The man struggles to get up and yells. Richard Murray gives a low growl and doubles back to him.</p><p>There’s a brief struggle. It ends with Richard Murray kicking the man in the face, knocking him out.</p><p>Mae loses her footing when she’s a few steps from the sidewalk. She collapses, shivering with cold and pain. Something must’ve happened to her brain when she banged her head on the ground: the world is in a vertigo and she can’t tell which way she was going towards. She crawls forward anyways: to move is to increase the odds of survival – her father lifts her up by her sweater and slams her down like a doll.</p><p>“Why do you hate me so much?” She blurts out.</p><p>“I’ll show you why!” Her father lands another kick on her back. She shrieks in pain and collapses.</p><p><em>That’s it.</em> She’s freezing. She’s broken. To get up requires a herculean effort she doesn’t possess. <em>That’s all there is for me.</em> Mae curls up in the middle of the road, grits her teeth, and waits to die.</p><p>How does it come to this, she can’t remember anymore. As her father kicks, slaps, punches, and throws her, she wonders incoherently whether she really is his daughter. Has it always been like this? Had there been happier times that she forgot? Her only memories of her father are ones of terror. Among these pieces of thoughts she cries for her mother, but who is it that she’s really yearning for? Definitely not Catherine Murray.</p><p>Her father’s roars stopped being intelligible long ago. How come nobody is coming out of their homes to help? Only the mister from the car tried and failed rather miserably. <em>Of course… a car isn’t a home. Home’s safe, and no idiot’s forsaking that for me. Me. Heh. Me. Understand Ruth sick for home. What a joke. Don’t have one.</em></p><p>She can’t feel her body anymore. She can’t feel her father’s blows, either. How many bones are broken in her body now? How many organs have ruptured from impact? How many breaths does she have left? <em>Snuff me out already.</em> She holds onto this only thought as she lies there, her red hair spreading around her under the streetlight like blood.</p><p><em>Mom didn’t even try to stop him. She never did.</em></p><p>Deep inside her, a memory breaks loose – more like a dream: a warm one, echoing with lullaby and filled with a sweet and comforting scent; a pair of loving hands patting her to sleep.</p><p>It’s shattered by a heart-splitting scream that Mae can hardly hear anymore. The next kick doesn’t connect with her body as something – someone clasps themselves around her, and with the sharp pain that follows she fades with that memory.</p><center>**</center><p>Max combs the wig smooth. It falls past Mae’s shoulder just to the spot her real hair does when loose. He hands the comb back to Julia and holds up a mirror.</p><p>“There. How is it?”</p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p>Max sees her crack expression, and smiles himself, too. It’s a small lift of the corners of her lips, her first since she woke up, as though she’s hiding it. Just like he remembers. Landon leans against the wall, arms crossed, and says,</p><p>“Nice.”</p><p>Julia swipes a stray strand behind Mae’s ear, saying,</p><p>“They’ll grow out before long.”</p><p>The doctors at the Bennon City Hospital had to shave Mae to stitch the wounds on her head. It was a rather nasty surprise for both her friends and her when they first visited her after she woke up two weeks ago. How did she make it through? Mae has gathered that she didn’t look good at all when they sent her in. Multiple fractured bones and internal bleeding. They had to literally patch her up in a series of surgeries, and even now, most of her body is thick with bandage, as was with her head. She’s tied down by wires and tubes to monitors by her bed; her right arm is in plaster, and even though her left arm isn’t, she has trouble holding anything steady. As for her legs, there is another surgery scheduled for tomorrow, and many more to come after that for other parts of her body.  She can’t do anything, not even cleaning herself. She feels ugly and gross.</p><p>“It’s some hell you’ve been through,” Landon says. “You’re tough. I’m glad you are alive, Mae.”</p><p>Mae doesn’t reply. Should <em>she</em> be glad? In the past nights, as her fractured memories resurfaced and tried to stitch themselves together, Mae relived that evening again and again in her nightmares. She has become scared of sleeping, staring out of the gap of the window curtains every night until she drifts off, only to jolt awake soon to the beeping of the cardiograph and sometimes the face of the nurse on duty. She dares not ask anyone when she’ll make a full recovery, or if she is able to at all. The future holds no light for her: in the end, she’ll always have to go back to her abysmal home. Sure, her father might be in jail again for this, but he’ll come out at some point. When he does, it’ll just start all over again, and her mother will still not stop him. <em>I haven’t seen her after I woke up, either.</em> Mae thinks. She never knew what it feels like to be angry. She just feels lonely and forsaken, even though her friends are aounding her bed.</p><p>The ward door slides open and her nurse comes with her lunch.</p><p>“We can take care of that.” Max receives it with both hands, face red under his ginger curls. “Thank you.”</p><p>“Oh no, thank <em>you</em>.” The nurse replies and says to Mae. “There are more visitors coming up right now, Mae. I think I see your mother.”</p><p>“Guess <em>I</em> better take over that. Can’t give Catherine the wrong idea.” Julia winks at Max.</p><p>Max returns a shy grin and hands over the tray.</p><p>“Say ‘ahhh’, Mae. Mm-hmm.” Landon leans over and peers at Julia cooling a spoonful of porridge down and feeding it to Mae. “Guess that means she’s finally out –”</p><p>“Eat up!” Julia coos Mae in an unnecessarily loud voice. She sends spoon after spoon of porridge over, as if to prevent Mae from asking what Landon means.</p><p>The ward door is thrown open.</p><p>Lily stand in the doorway on crutches, panting with effort. She looks up and around the bright room, and limps in as fast as she can, hopping over the last few meters. Julia and Max retreats just in time as Lily drops her crutches and throws herself onto Mae. Mae draws a sharp breath and winces.</p><p>“I’m sorry.” Lily mumbles, balancing on one foot. “I’m so sorry.”</p><p>“I see you got off the wheelchair.” Landon says.</p><p>“About time, too.” Lily sits down on the edge of the bed with her back turned to Mae and Julia. She casts a swift glance at Mae’s arm, grabs the plaster and squeezes it.</p><p>“What’s wrong?” Mae asks. “Are you alright?” Lily remains silent. Mae looks at the others. “What happened?”</p><p>Julia, Landon, and Max look at each other and hesitate. Lily looks at the floor and says nothing. Mae sees a newly-healed scar exposed on the back of her neck under her black ponytail. Outside the door Lily’s mother appear, and behind them, Mae sees the small figure of her own mother, pale and frail. “Lily?” She whispers. “Tell me, please?”</p><p>“How are you feeling, dear?” Lily’s mother comes in and kisses Mae.</p><p>“What happened to Lily?” Mae asks.</p><p>“I fell down! Please!” Lily pleads. Lily and her mother look at each other for a long moment. Mae can’t see her friend’s face but the her mother looks conflicted. Catherine walks to a corner and sits down, far from Mae’s bed. Julia, Landon, and Max decides to busy themselves with feeding Mae the rest of her lunch.</p><p>“Please don’t take the wrong way, Mae,” Lily’s mother begins. “She just doesn’t want you to blame yourself. Seeing what happened to you that night didn’t sit well with her, either.” Lily pulls her knees to her chin and squeezes her eyes shut. “She covered Richard’s blows for you.”</p><p>“Right after we got home, mom got an emergency call from you.” Comes Lily’s muffled voice. Mae blinks. “You were crying for help – the phone recognized that. It was cut off fast. I think your phone broke.”</p><p><em>From my fall? Well, that’s that with my phone, then. Less than two weeks of service.</em> Mae thinks.</p><p>“I ran over to your house.” Lily breaks off. Her mother lays a hand on her head.</p><p>“And that was probably when she saw you and threw herself over you.”</p><p>“I was ahead of mom and dad. I think later dad managed to overpower Richard Murray.”</p><p>“Lily was just in time.” Her mother finishes. “The last few blows were particularly furious. They fractured her hips and broke her leg. The neighbors apparently called the police. We found the the injured man and sent Lily and him to Alvar hospital. Your condition was too severe and you were brought here.”</p><p>Mae sees her mother sits in her chair looking at the floor like a statue. This can’t be the first time <em>she</em> hears of the story, can it? The man from the car and Lily threw themselves in her father’s way, but her mother seems to have done little from the start.</p><p>“Thank you.” Mae moves her arm to Lily, who grabs onto the plaster again. “I’m –”</p><p>“I made a choice.” Lily says thickly into her knee. “So did that man.”</p><p>“There’s nothing more natural than buying one’s father a present, even if that decision comes with consequences.” Lily’s mother says. “Nobody in here did wrong other than Richard.”</p><p>The door slides open for a third time. Lily’s father comes in, his face mirthless - scary, even. He looks around.</p><p>“Everyone’s here. How are you, Mae? That’s a pretty wig.” He gives her and her friends a quick smile and says to his wife, “Ryan and Diane did <em>not</em> take the news well. Said I should’ve told them earlier.”</p><p>“That can’t be helped. Don’t want them charge in with Mae unconscious.” She says. “And the hearing?”</p><p>“Cate needs to make a decision. Right now.” He’s more serious than Mae has even seen him. “It’s the holidays next week and the court’ll be closed until January. It’ll also be much more difficult once Richard gets inside.” Lily unfurls herself and turns to Catherine, as with her parents. The rest looks as puzzled as Mae is. “I’m sorry to pressure you, but it’s been long enough. You need to make a decision, your god or your daughter and yourself.”</p><p>Max is the first to understand, but Julia is the one who dares voicing it.</p><p>“Are you going to divorce?”</p><p>Mae hears her mother give a shaky gasp, and realizes that she has been weeping all this time, perhaps since she sat down. For the first time Mae is watching her mother cry.</p><p>“I’m sorry. I’m not that brave –” Catherine sobs.</p><p>“You’re brave enough to consider divorce already. What do you people say?” Lily’s father asks the kids.</p><p>“Hell yeah.” Landon says. Julia and Max nod in agreement.</p><p>“Besides, you gave Mae almost half of your blood as well as your bone marrow without even hesitating. If that’s not brave I don’t know what is.” He crosses his arms. Mae finally understands why her mother looks so pale. He turns to her, “Yeah, she’s just out of hospital herself. You’ve lost too much blood, sweet.”</p><p>Lily’s mother walks over and crouches before Catherine’s hunched figure. She places a hand on her arm.</p><p>“Cate, you have already made the decision, didn’t you? You just need to summon that courage and say it.”</p><p>“What if he comes for revenge?”</p><p>“We’ll be there.”</p><p>Catherine sniffs and nods.</p><p>“I will press it.”</p><p>Lily’s mother breaks into a smile of relief and Lily’s father whistles.</p><p>“Great! We’ll go sign it in the afternoon, then. Makes the scolding from Mae’s grandparents much easier to bear. Now what’s up with my girl?” Lily’s father grins.</p><p>“She fell asleep.” Mae says.</p><p>“That was fast. She can finally sleep well, I think. Been having nightmares about you every night. It really wasn’t a pretty sight…” He picks up Lily’s crutches and leans them against the bed, and crouches down to level his eyes with Mae’s. His hitherto hard expression softens. “You’re tough, Mae. Not sure about you, but I’m glad you’re alive.”</p><p>“That’s what I said.” Landon stretches. “See, that’s what everyone says.”</p><p>“Go figure.” Lily’s father gives Landon a fist bump across the bed. “Anyone want lunch? Come on, kids. Iris? Cate?”</p><p>“You go.” Catherine says to Lily’s mother, who nods and stands up. They left.</p><p>Outside the window is the drifting snow. Inside the ward is equally silent. Mae avoids looking at her mother, and stares at Lily hunched at the edge of her bed, sleeping, instead. <em>How can she even hold up the posture for so long?</em> As soon as she finishes the thought, Lily sways and falls sideways onto the bed, and sleeps on. Mae peers at her neck. The scar she saw earlier was just one of many. She had stitches, too.</p><p>It’s because of her and that mister from the car that she’s alive. And perhaps her mother. Yes, her mother. It seems that everything will end well for them, at least. Yet Mae can’t help but feel there’s one piece missing.</p><p>Catherine moves her chair next to Mae’s bed with an effort, breaking her thoughts, and sits staring at Mae’s wrist. <em>Hm?</em> Mae looks at her.</p><p>“Richard’s in custody. I should let you know.” Catherine starts, voice thick. “The man that tried to help you was a police officer off-duty. I don’t know how that’ll be taken into account.”</p><p>“Right.” Mae manages to say. <em>No, this isn’t it…</em></p><p>“Will you forgive me?” Catherine starts again, almost timid. “For being a bad mother?” Mae looks up and meeting her mother’s big eyes. She looks like she has been through a lot in the past month, too. It’s rare to find anything in her eyes, usually, other than terror. “I was always too scared to stop him. Will you forgive me?”</p><p><em>I don’t know. And this isn’t what’s missing, either.</em> Mae thinks. She asks instead, “Were you scared? During the bone marrow transplant?”</p><p>“It was the least she can do,” comes Lily’s drowsily voice. Mae jumps. When did she wake up? “You need to earn her forgiveness.” She flips around, legs dangling over the side of the bed, looking groggily at Catherine.</p><p>Lily is known for her directness that borders harshness, but Mae is still surprised that she takes it to an adult. She’s even more surprised by her mother dipping her head in earnest and obedience. Lily sighs and flings an arm over Mae’s body. Mae winces, and Lily falls asleep again.</p><p>“Mom. There’s something in my bag that’s wrapped in blue paper.” Mae mumbles. “It’s for you. I hope it didn’t break when I dropped it.”</p><p>“We’ll open it together when you are home. For now –” She hesitates.</p><p>It’s long overdue, the kiss that her mother plants on her forehead. </p><p><em>There.</em></p>]]></content>

      &lt;p&gt;“We certainly weren’t &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; loud when we were freshmen.” Lily glances around the cafeteria. Wading through the chattering crowd with an empty stomach, only to find a rather cramped table for four in a corner is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; her ideal first day of senior year in middle school. Her friends nod in agreement. “I wish it’s still summer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Definitely not ready for school, no.” Julia pulls an extra chair over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No kidding.” Landon comes over with a slice of cheese cake, four cupcakes, and two big chunks of brownie. He hands on brownie to Max and tries to stuff the other into Julia’s mouth, and gives the cupcake plate to Lily and Mae. “I guess especially you, Mae, since you missed most of it in the Treasure Trove.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Before us is a door, and beyond that, the stage. On the stage is the dark red velvet curtain pulled shut, and on the other side, we know, is whatever is out there. I stand beside Mae in her chair. She seems to be chewing her lips.</p><p>“It’ll be the time soon.” I say to her. “Are you alright?”</p><p>“Not really.” She turns to me, big green eyes full of anxiety. “Do I look appropriate?” She’s in a white cashmere sweater and white woolen dress. She sits on the cushioned chair with only the pointed toes of her brown semi-combat boots touching the floor. She hates heels so there aren’t any. I knew Ryan would puff out his chest and say, “She picked out everything herself!” Indeed she did. Her flame-red hair is tied, not in the hair bun her mother forces to wear all the time, but the crown braid the Lius fixed for her, which she loves.</p><a id="more"></a><p>I look down at myself. Red hand-knit sweater with the right sleeve cuff breaking apart and a yarn-sewn patch at the left elbow. Blue-white plaid shirt sticking out of the bottom of the said sweater. Straight-fit jeans with its denim flaking off at the seams. Dirty sneakers that I should’ve washed last Winter Solstice. My black hair tinted red under the full-spectrum light above the backstage is too long, but not long enough to tie up, not to mention that I didn’t wash it last night.</p><p>“I think I should ask that, heh heh.” I laugh nervously. She giggles.</p><p>“I think you’re fine.”</p><p>“Then so are you.”</p><p>And we fall silent, her looking at her knees as usual and I at the door.</p><p>“It’s been… quite some weeks.” She starts after a while. “I was forced to remember things I don’t want to remember.”</p><p>“I’m sorry.” I apologize. “It reminded me of things I’d rather forget, as well.”</p><p>“I guess we aren’t that different.”</p><p>“No, not really.” I take a deep breath. “See, you and Lily, and Billy and Iris… all of you have something that I have. Presenting you lot out there is like presenting myself. Sometimes I have to be extra careful about what I say out there, and how I say it. Whatever you’re feeling, I understand.”</p><p>“Mm-hmm.” She looks up. “So you… you’ve—?”</p><p>“Not as severe as you. Not as often. I’m sorry you have to go through that.” I take a deep breath again. “But you’re tough. You survived, and I don’t think you’ve ever shed a single tear.” I grin at her. “Much better than I did.”</p><p>“There are other factors, though… Help from other places that -“ She grins at me in return, “—we can’t say. I wouldn’t have made a full recovery—oh no, I wouldn’t have made it to the hospital had Iris not…” She trails off.</p><p>“Nope, we can’t talk about that. Gotta leave it to their imagination, and spare some eyerolls from Mr. McGlynn.”</p><p>“What’s your favorite part in this?”</p><p>“Other than writing it all down and editing it?” I make a pout. “Hmm… probably going to the mall. I like the Keats part. It’s brilliant. <em>You’re</em> brilliant. Keats is brilliant.”</p><p>“Sometimes you needn’t hold back sticking your own touch in here.”</p><p>“No, I suppose not. What’s yours? Your favorite part?”</p><p>“Shopping in the mall.” She looks embarrassed. “Hey, and since nobody’s listening… it’s also Max and Julia feeding me lunch. Oh… what am I saying…” She covers her eyes. “…and mom kissing me for the first time.”</p><p>“That you remember, at least.” I look away. “Listen… I’m sorry about all that. I feel extremely bad about it. You don’t deserve it at all.”</p><p>“It’s my dad, anyways.” She says shortly. Then she uncovers her eyes, looking serious. “What is he like before that, or has he always been like that?”</p><p>“I actually don’t know.” I begin to wonder, too. “A violent alcoholic who’s violent even without alcohol, coming from an apparently normal, non-violent family… See, if there’s a character I don’t like, then I don’t tend to try figure them out. Oh, it’s not the other way around, you should know. I don’t know what your mother’s like before, either.”</p><p>“The god isn’t as omnipotent as they say, huh.”</p><p>“I never was one.” I laugh.</p><p>“How long have you been doing this? Presenting everyone with you?”</p><p>“Years and years ago. But on this stage? Five, I think? Made it here on a whim and then decided to stick to it. Arrived at midnight and realized, ‘Oh, it’s Winter Solstice! Maybe I should do it every year.’ Well, frankly at first I thought I’m doing it for my friends. Then I realized that I may not have that many. Then I realized again that I don’t need to do it for others, that I’m enjoying it, however hard it is every year, finding the right people, finding the right experience, finding the right words, and even finding the right audience. The very first one was actually Iris and Billy. I got laughed at for presenting someone that’s so similar to me, you know? They thought I was talking about myself… But only a true artist knows what the deal is. I’m sure you do.” Mae smiles and nods. “Then I presented them again, and again, and thought, maybe I’ll do them forever. Well, I found someone else. Someone I don’t think you know.”</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>“An old man and his dog. Er, his robot. It looks like a dog. Anyways, I’d say that’s my best choice to date. Almost made it to some regional prize. But I guess I’m really not that good. Then there’s last year. It… Well. I like them. William and Lindsay. I tend to find people like me, and they tend to share my last name. I don’t know how to feel about that.”</p><p>“I mean, if you’re comfortable with it, I think it’s fine.”</p><p>“You really are kind, Mae.”</p><p>“Keep talking. It keeps my mind off—“ She points at the door.</p><p>“Right. So. They came to me in a dream. Also about dogs. I asked Mr. McGlynn about them. He gave me his usual oh-the-stake oh-the-drama morbidity. I did my best to incorporate them. Well. Sent it out. Mixed reviews I don’t really trust. One prestigious editor let me down gently; ‘doesn’t pique his interest’. We both know what he meant, though, no? ‘Your story’s boring. Go find some other idiot to bother.’”</p><p>Mae pats my arm in comfort.</p><p>“This year might be worse, though. Who knows.” I mumble.</p><p>“But you enjoy doing it.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Then that’s something right there.”</p><p>The door swings open. Mae and I jumped. A cloaked figure comes in. The MC of the World, that’s what Mae calls him.</p><p>“Hey you, yes you,” he points at me. “You and Mae, get ready. The next time this door opens you’re up. And, you,” he points at me again, “do something about your hair!”</p><p>“Shut up about my hair!” I snap. “I’m not doing anything about it after the first month of the new Lunar year! And yeah, I got a name, dammit!”</p><p>But he already went out and pulled the door shut. Mae is wearing a weird smile at me: half-laughing at our exchange and half-grimacing at the news.</p><p>“Okay. Okay.” I breathe. I bite my lips. I crouch down beside Mae’s chair. “Okay.” Pep talk, for her and for me. “Okay. We’ve worked hard in the past two weeks. We slept late. We doubted ourselves. We patted ourselves on the back for the good parts. We were close to breaking down remembering those things. We went over the whole thing three times, and they say three times is the charm. We gave it our best. We are tough and we made it through on time. Okay? Okay.</p><p>“Even after five years I still have no idea what’s out there. For all of our work, there might be nobody out there. There might also be people roasting us—“</p><p>“What if they are firing at me? Calling me Mary Sue?”</p><p>“Last time I checked, Mary Sue never knew of the life you know. Mary Sue is an idiot since her creation, but Mary Ann, you, Mae, you are an angel. Okay? Okay. If you call me god, then you’re an angel. No arguing. Besides, if they fire at you, I’ll take it for you like Lily did. I’ll-I’ll even fire back. Yeah, I’ll fire back…” I repeat to myself. “Yes. I shall defend you.”</p><p>“I’m sorry I can’t do much for you as well…” She looks suddenly downcast.</p><p>“No. You’re here to keep me happy, and that’s good enough. You, Lily, Billy, Iris, Julia, Landon, Nar’fiius, many others I presented—everyone. It’s great. I-I—“</p><p>“Here…”</p><p>Mae gets off her chair and hugs me tight. I screw my eye shut and let it flow.</p><p>“I’m sorry about making you go through all that.” I say again. “And just now I was supposed to comfort you.”</p><p>“I’m scared.” She looks into my eyes. “You are, too, huh.”</p><p>“Every single time.”</p><p>“But this is the first time you say something about it to the people you present.”</p><p>“First time to record it, as well. And that makes this special, I guess.”</p><p>“More bearable?”</p><p>“Yes. We are in this together.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>I steel myself, and so does Mae.</p><p>“Mary Ann Murray.” I say.</p><p>“Billy Liu.” She says.</p><p>“It’s our turn.” We nod to each other.</p><p>The door swings open and the MC of the World—others call him Time; I call him Fate—poor guy, really, only a cloak and bones after all those time; every time I see him I want to smash him into bits for making me suffer—do you know, that people doesn’t even know if he really is a “he”? Maybe he’s a “she” and maybe he’s like <em>C. elegans</em>, <em>hermaphroditic</em>, and maybe he’s genderless—but I digress. The MC of the World as per Mae beckons his skeletal hand and says,</p><p>“Quickly! Quickly! The Winter Solstice is upon us!” and he holds the door open.</p><p>I stand up and hold a hand out for Mae. She takes it, smiling through her wet eyes.</p><p>“Be brave. Be tough.” She says.</p><p>Our thin figures pass through the door. Beyond that is the silent velvet curtain. It’s quiet. It’s dark. We can hear the beating of our own hearts. We stand waiting, hand in hand, and our hands begin to sweat.</p><p>“Oops.” Mae and I smile at each other.</p><p>The curtains part without warning and brilliant light floods over us. </p><p>This is it.</p><p>This our turn.</p><p>“<em>Hello, World.</em>“ We say.</p>]]></content>

      &lt;p&gt;Before us is a door, and beyond that, the stage. On the stage is the dark red velvet curtain pulled shut, and on the other side, we know, is whatever is out there. I stand beside Mae in her chair. She seems to be chewing her lips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’ll be the time soon.” I say to her. “Are you alright?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Not really.” She turns to me, big green eyes full of anxiety. “Do I look appropriate?” She’s in a white cashmere sweater and white woolen dress. She sits on the cushioned chair with only the pointed toes of her brown semi-combat boots touching the floor. She hates heels so there aren’t any. I knew Ryan would puff out his chest and say, “She picked out everything herself!” Indeed she did. Her flame-red hair is tied, not in the hair bun her mother forces to wear all the time, but the crown braid the Lius fixed for her, which she loves.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>&quot;Do you think he&#39;ll be home when we get back?&quot; Lindsay asks behind the wheels. Cars glide through the streets of Kanten Av Skogen before her in the long Scandinavian winter night, the noise of their engines muffled by the thin mist flooding the town. Early Scandinavian winter brings an early evening; only a layer of glass keeps the chill at bay.</p><p>&quot;He will. Don&#39;t worry. Charlie always comes back from his wanderings before six. He&#39;s smart even for a dog.&quot; William soothes her.</p><a id="more"></a><p>Red light.</p><p>&quot;How does he tell the time? I always wonder if he actually knows how to read.&quot;</p><p>&quot;There&#39;s the church bell.&quot; William points at the silhouette of a steeple blocks away. &quot;We usually get back around the time it strikes six.&quot;</p><p>They drive down the street. A few straggling leaves hang on the branches, cold, damp, helpless. The month-old leaf carpet on the sidewalks were cleaned up yesterday, and today the cement looks too bare. The entire town seems to be in slumber. Lifeless.</p><p>&quot;Look, life.&quot; William murmurs, contradicting her thoughts. She turns in surprise.</p><p>To their right, a small group of children run past a lamp post towards the crossing, their bright yellow and red and blue winter jackets making up for the colorless day. Two women follow them, each holding a smaller child by hand. The darker-skinned mother&#39;s call comes through the window, telling her son to stop leading the group onto the street. The black boy running before the others stops a good distance from the edge. They stood babbling. Two girls giggle behind their hands, and the boy in front of them whips around and snaps at them. The other mother has to walk over to break them up. Lindsay can almost see their voice cutting through the air. With it come the thoughts from the black mother and Lindsay catches them: a sense of pride for her son to lead the group of and a slight regret of him not being the one to break up the bicker. Telepathy: it is as natural as sight and hearing for William and her.</p><p>&quot;Imagine us becoming part of a neighborhood pick-up group.&quot; William gives a small laugh. &quot;I&#39;ll have a hard time keeping them down.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You don&#39;t have to.&quot; Lindsay says, her amber eyes glued to the group.</p><p>&quot;How was lab?&quot; He asks.</p><p>&quot;Pfft. The antibody today is just a nuisance. Hypersensitive to temperature and concentration. Amped up the antibody concentration today and I was lucky to finish it before lunch. This means I&#39;ll have to go back after dinner to do the rest.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I can go back for my PCR results, too - it&#39;ll be good to save some time for tomorrow morning.&quot; He reaches over and swipes a strand of her disheveled blond hair behind her ear. &quot;We&#39;ll have to sneak Charlie in, then.&quot;</p><p>The car pulls into the driveway, and they get into the house.</p><p>Musky warmth wraps around them and draws them in, saying its welcome. This two-story house has been their home for the past five years. They step into its red brick walls and William flicks on the light, taking in the familiar yellow walls and dark red wooden doors. Lindsay hangs her coat and scarf in the closet on left and goes into the guest toilet next to it. Down the hall is the door to the study, and to the right is the archway to the living room. Through this William enters and looks around. Everything is still. He moves to the joint kitchen and dining room, passing the TV, the sofa, and the fireplace, and then back to the long end table in front of the TV. In the wall mirror behind the sofa he sees the thin, bespectacled reflection of a black-haired young man of 29 returning his frown, his willow leaf-shaped eyes wide with alarm.</p><p>&quot;Charlie?&quot; He calls. From the hallway comes the sound of flushing. He goes back into the kitchen, checking the dog bowls and the flap on the back door. The flap is on the outside.</p><p>&quot;He&#39;s not in the study.&quot; Lindsay calls.</p><p>&quot;Nor the kitchen, either,&quot; he replies. &quot;The flap is still out. He isn&#39;t back.&quot; <em>A dog can&#39;t get lost, can it?</em> Lindsay joins him in the living room, and in silence they head upstairs.</p><p>The two empty spare bedrooms, the shared bathroom, their own bathroom—nothing. Back in their own room Lindsay crouches down next to Charlie&#39;s untouched blankets. When did he leave? The dog has been in there last night, but was gone before they were up. William sits down on the bed, and Lindsay asks without turning,</p><p>&quot;Is his bowl empty?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Just how I left them last night.&quot; He replies simply, sitting at the edge of the bed, elbows on knees and chin supported by his hands.</p><p>&quot;So he left without eating?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I suppose…&quot; with that he wanders away in mind, leaving the ticking of their clock in his wake.</p><p>Lindsay isn&#39;t a stranger to silence. Ever since they&#39;ve met it had been part of their lives. &quot;The boon of an introvert,&quot; they would both joke sometimes. But the silence now is not the usual quietness, but a void. It gains weight with every <em>tick</em> from the clock a few meters away on the bed stand. Lindsay reaches out with telepathy. Outside, a passing neighbor is thinking about what to cook when she gets home. The Berg family is busy with their three children doing parkour throughout their house. Mrs. Olsen, their older neighbor, is knitting and thinking about the snowfall later in the evening. They are effortless to read, just mundane thoughts drifting around like dandelion fluffs in wind.</p><p>No thoughts of Lindsay&#39;s or of their neighbors&#39; manage to revive William, however. The pang of worry from the thought that Charlie had left empty-stomach snaps into a dark thought. <em>Did someone snatch him away when he was relieving in the yard?</em> No, it couldn&#39;t be. Kanten is safe, and there are dogs more valuable that a gold retriever around. Who with a sound mind would steal a dog in the winter, anyways? As if the dog can&#39;t bark. <em>Then he left willingly? Why?</em> Before he knew it, William reaches an even darker thought: Charlie knows he&#39;s dying and he left to die, alone… <em>Nah, he&#39;s just out of his puppy-hood.</em> And with that, his thoughts disperse, leaving him in a trance.</p><p>A chime reverberates through the city, and the strike for six o&#39;clock draws out in full, pulling him out of his reverie. His mind chimes along with the bell, three seconds between each &quot;clang&quot;. When the echo of the last strike ebbs away he says in his soft voice,</p><p>&quot;Six o&#39;clock,&quot; as though he just woke up.</p><p>&quot;Six o&#39;clock.&quot; Lindsay echoes.</p><p>&quot;Don&#39;t cry.&quot; He looks at her.</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m not.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Let&#39;s have dinner first,&quot; he stands and lifts her up. &quot;We can ask around the neighbors after that, and then head to the lab.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No. No–You cook. I&#39;m asking the neighbors right now.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Just Mrs. Olsen and the Bergs, okay?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don&#39;t fuss!&quot; She&#39;s already at the bottom of the stairs.</p><p>&quot;Hey I don&#39;t need you go missing, too!&quot; William calls halfway down the stairs. He hears the click of front door. <em>For once I can&#39;t keep up with her.</em> He thinks and heads into the kitchen.</p><p>Rice needs 40 minutes to get ready. There&#39;s still more than half a pot of pork rib soup left. William checks the amount of tofu and carrots and napa cabbage inside, and remembered they ate most of the cabbages yesterday. He turns on first the exhaust and then the stove, and draws out from the freezer a small bag of side pork, sliced and seasoned. This he throws into a big bowl of hot water, muttering, &quot;Should&#39;ve thawed it in the morning.&quot; He considers thawing it with the fireplace, instead he gets out a small rack and a bag of bak choi.</p><p>As he snips the ends off of the small shoots William remembers the first time he ate with Lindsay&#39;s family. Around a table set with chicken soup, steamed broccoli, salad, and a huge bowl of rice sat her parents and her two younger sisters, Mikaela and Ruth. He felt awkward and overwhelmed, coming from a small Chinese family that doesn&#39;t eat dinner together often and his grandmother being his only dining companion. How surprised she would be had she known what were on the dinner table of an American family. No pizza or pasta or fancy steaks, but food so normal that she would scoff at.</p><p>Done with the snipping, William checks on the side pork. Half thawed. Ice-packed on the inside. <em>Icy,</em> he thinks with bitterness. His mother used to call him that. <em>Only to her. Mom was never too caring a mom, either.</em> No one in his family is telepathic. Not that it would help much, he knows, but William can&#39;t help but delude himself that had it been otherwise, his relationship with his parents would have been much better. At least then, they&#39;d have something in common, a connection more concrete than blood.</p><p>The sound of boiling and the fragrance of pork, tofu, and carrot reach him. &quot;Grandma&#39;s recipe,&quot; as he always introduces the soup. She who taught him cooking, the chef in the family. She was a chef of a restaurant for decades in her younger days, known for her recipes. Those imprecise &quot;pinches&quot; of salt and &quot;couples&quot; of garlic and some &quot;whiles&quot; of simmering kept him warm in winters regardless where he was, be it China, America, or Norway. When his parents&#39; divorce broke the family apart, her meals kept the surviving mothers and son together. Cooking her recipes makes William feel at home, and he often wonders whether meals are essential for a family. To sit down together and eat, and talk about the day or the past or the future, a symbol of peace and reunion. When his father was home, as he seldom was, he&#39;d often tell William off for not eating meat or scold William for the way he held his chopsticks during meals. His grandmother never failed to fire up and tell his father to shut up and eat. &quot;Take your bickering elsewhere! This is our family&#39;s dining table!&quot;</p><p>He turns down the fire to simmering and the pork ball finally thaws out. He rips open the bag and spreads them at the bottom of the bowl, and then washes his hands and the bak choi leaves. Dirt smears the sink.</p><p>Grandma was always home. His father was elsewhere most of the time, either getting his PhD or working as a postdoc, staying at home for three months at a time at most. His mother, the <em>de facto</em> breadwinner before her divorce, was usually out there working. She was the material matron, but what was good with material alone? Is she still a qualified mother if she didn&#39;t care for him? His father called weekly while he was away, but without his presence he was only a disembodied voice fussing about things that he either disagrees or could never help with. He can&#39;t be a parent if he&#39;s absent, and when he was present, so were harsh criticisms and beatings caused by small mistakes or a wrong word. Slowly William stopped revealing much to him, be it over the phone or in person. He doesn&#39;t need to know.</p><p>&quot;What is a parent?&quot; William asks the cleaned bak choi leaves. &quot;Is it someone who feeds me or someone who gives birth to me? Is my grandma my parent, or my grandparent?&quot;</p><p>Silence.</p><p>The front door clicks, faint over the sound of water and the simmering soup. Lindsay makes a beeline to the stove, inhales, and without a word lifts the lid and fishes out a rib with a ladle. William watches in amusement as she gasps in pain from the heat, puffing. She first drops the lid back on with a <em>clang</em> and then the rib into the ladle, fanning her burnt hand at her burnt tongue. William drags her hand under the tap and fans her mouth himself.</p><p>&quot;No hot tofu for the hasty ones, Lin,&quot; he recalls an old Chinese idiom. &quot;That was fast. I thought it&#39;d take you a while.&quot; He pulls the bak choi bowl aside. &quot;No luck?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No,&quot; Lindsay takes a bite at the rib again, &quot;it&#39;s dinnertime, and they&#39;re all eating. I got hungry… Do you think Charlie knows how to hunt?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No.&quot; He decides to be honest. &quot;Here, finish that bit and I&#39;ll cook the veggies. We&#39;ll put up some fliers before we leave, okay?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hopefully we can finish our work early enough to look for him ourselves.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah.&quot; William isn&#39;t convinced. &quot;How&#39;s the rib? Not overcooked, are they?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Grandma&#39;s recipe.&quot; Lindsay says, eyes closed and chewing.</p><center>**</center><p>&quot;Rule number one in labs: nothing works.&quot; William scowled when they get back later in the evening. &quot;Rule number two: if something worked, it was pure luck.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ugh.&quot; Lindsay replies, &quot;at least those aren&#39;t human errors… or stupidity. Count on lab techs to chuck your stuff away. I&#39;m off for a shower.&quot;</p><p>It&#39;s almost 11. William drops into the sofa and takes out his phone. He scrolls through his messages and feeds out of pure habit. His family and most of his friends are either on the other side of the continent or the other side of the ocean. Nothing new has come up since lunch except for a friend located in Scotland showing off the airplane engine his team finished working on. There are photos of cars on flooded streets, pictures of passages from books, cat gifs, news on a new regulation for internet news censorship, and his friend&#39;s small daily achievements. His mother has photos of her and his grandma out by the sea (<em>bless her years,</em> he thinks, <em>a near centenarian looking like in her late 70s. Mom&#39;s been taking her out more and more now.</em>). His childhood friend, Tong, shows off his baby daughter. William studies it: the baby&#39;s face is a perfect replica of his friend&#39;s when the latter was a boy. Back home they say the daughter resembles the father, and William wonders what his daughter (if he ever wants to get one) would look like. Perhaps her hair would take an explicit brown tint after her mother&#39;s blond hair, or she might have his willow-leaf shaped eyes.</p><p>The sound of the bathroom door from upstairs pulls William out of his thoughts. He is taken aback for a moment as his telepathy starts to connect him with the world around him—distant, unintelligible thoughts from his neighbors and pedestrians blocks away whisper softly in his mind. If he tries just a little harder, he could read them clearly, and perhaps even sense minds of those living at the edge of the town. <em>The collective unconsciousness would probably be real if everyone is telepathic.</em> He thinks. <em>But it does come with prices.</em></p><p>William gets up and changes the bowl of dog food and water in the kitchen. <em>You never know. He might come back at night.</em></p><center>**</center><p>Lindsay wraps her arm around him at once when he gets in bed after his shower, holding onto him as if to merge with him, and he returns the pressure.</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s snowing.&quot; She whispers.</p><p>His heart skips a beat. Charlie never go out on snow days alone. William can&#39;t even remember when their dog started walking himself. They raised it from a puppy, and walked him daily. Charlie started walking himself outside on weekends. <em>Maybe he&#39;s lonely.</em> There aren&#39;t that many dog owners around and he wanted to try his luck outside the neighborhood. William has a small hope that the dog met another and is taken in by her owner for the night. <em>Or he might be caught and sent to some stray dog shelter. I shall make a call tomorrow.</em> But for now, there&#39;s nothing they can do.</p><p>&quot;Will,&quot; Lindsay murmurs, &quot;what are you thinking?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Charlie, of course.&quot; He replies, &quot;Nothing we can do right now, though.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No.&quot; She agrees. &quot;Anything new in your feeds?&quot; <em>Anything,</em> she thinks, <em>anything to take my mind off our dog.</em></p><p>&quot;My friend, Tong—do you remember him?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, the one from your elementary school? Merry as a cricket?&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&#39;s him.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What about him?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s more about his baby daughter. Two years old today. Man you gotta see her face! Chubby like her dad&#39;s.&quot; He reaches for his phone and flips to the feed. The nine bright photos bloom onto the screen all at once. On one, the baby is squinting or maybe smiling or even bawling at the camera. On another, she sits in her mother&#39;s lap wearing a set of floral full-body baby pajamas, and her laughing mother is holding a birthday hat just out of the baby&#39;s reach. They go on and on, with the baby in the hat, the hat in the cake, the baby&#39;s face in the cake, the mother&#39;s and the father&#39;s faces in the cake… <em>What a happy family,</em> William thinks, <em>Don&#39;t know how Tong managed it. Wonder what it feels like?</em></p><p>&quot;All babies are alike. Cute.&quot; Lindsay snorts.</p><p>&quot;Look at that round nose and the chubby cheeks. They are signature Tong.&quot; William prods the screen. &quot;And look at that chin and those eyes and them small earlobes. No one else has them except her mom. I do hope she also has her mother&#39;s brains, ha ha.&quot; He strokes her hair.</p><p>&quot;Don&#39;t be a jerk. She&#39;ll merge the best of everything. What&#39;s her name again?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Xingyan. Literally means a look like the stars above.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;ll take it to mean &#39;bright and shiny&#39;, I suppose… Sounds like Celeste.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don&#39;t know what they had in mind when they named her, but I&#39;ll pass Celeste along if she ever needs an English name.&quot; William shrugs. &quot;Say, if we ever have a kid, what do you think she&#39;d look like?&quot; He feels her heartbeat becomes quicker through layers of pajamas.</p><p>&quot;I can&#39;t even imagine her hair color. It could be anywhere between my blond to your black.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Or maybe a blend of our eye shapes, a bit round and slanted down at the outside but with pointed ends.&quot;</p><p>&quot;But the nose will be the same round one.&quot; She says loftily.</p><p>&quot;Hope she got your chin, though.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Pfft. She&#39;d better. Yours is too straight.&quot; Lindsay looks at the window curtains.</p><p>&quot;That&#39;s racist.&quot; He jibes.</p><p>&quot;Urgh don&#39;t get me started.&quot; She rolls her eyes.</p><p>&quot;Almost makes me want to have one just to see her.&quot; William said without thinking, distracted again by Tong with his face in the cake.</p><p>Lindsay opens her lips to speak, but stops. With a confused frown, she buries her head between his shoulder and the pillow. <em>What&#39;s wrong?</em> William thinks. Lindsay reaches over, flicking off the light and planting a kiss on his lips at the same time.</p><p>&quot;Alright, dreamtime.&quot; He plugs his phone.</p><p>Lindsay says nothing. She buries her head back into his shoulder and in a minute, William hears her soft breathing. Her head sinks deeper and slips onto the pillow. William lies awake staring at the ceiling that&#39;s swallowed by the night, wondering what&#39;s on her mind. No help from telepathy.</p><p>Telepathy. <em>&quot;Communication from one mind to another by extrasensory means&quot;. Merriam-Webster.</em> He recites to himself. <em>The communication of impressions of any kind from one mind to another, independently of the recognized channels of sense. OED.</em> Communication. Extrasensory. Beyond or outside ordinary senses. What&#39;s more important in this definition, communication or extrasensory? <em>If I can&#39;t communicate but only perceive, does it still count?</em> In the dark, William revisits his own metaphor for telepathy: one with telepathy—the telepath—is like a human mirror. The mirror sees what anything that passes by is (<em>Perception,</em> he says to himself). The passerby, however, can only see his own reflections when he (<em>—or she, does it matter? —</em>) looks at the mirror, but not the mirror itself. If the mirrors want to, they can distort the reflection into whatever they want, and might even convince the passerby that the distorted reflections are accurate depictions, and the passerby will walk away with a thought, or an idea… such as they have a long face, or their legs are uneven, or they are small and insignificant… (<em>Injection,</em> he recites). Furthermore, if the mirror is enticing enough, the passerby might lose the &quot;self&quot;, forgetting that he or she is the original, and mimic what the reflection does… (<em>…and Manipulation.</em> He adds.)</p><p>But what happens when the mirrors meet each other?</p><p>William feels a tinge of sorrow whenever he reaches this point.</p><p><em>An endless tunnel of mirrors reflecting mirrors… no matter how they move and distort the reflection. That&#39;s how they know: who they are and who themselves are.</em></p><p>Darkness thickens, and William isn&#39;t sure whether his eyes are open anymore. He feels the thick quilt over him, he feels the warm body next to him, and he feels the soft mattress under him. <em>But no matter how hard I try I can&#39;t—</em></p><center>**</center><p>Lindsay wakes up to a stiff cheekbone. The room is still dark, and it takes her a moment to realize that half of her face was stuck against William&#39;s shoulder all night. She shuts her eyes and groans.</p><p><em>For god&#39;s sake get some exercise and grow some muscles…</em></p><p>What she knows about energy and biological development tells her that all telepaths should be slimmer than average as a result of the extra energy required for the extra sensory. What she knows about evolutionary development tells her that such high-cost of energy would&#39;ve made it near impossible for the trait of telepathy to be passed down, especially in the early days when food is scarce. What her daily life tells her that had it not been coffee, such high energy cost will make her drowsy all the time.</p><p><em>But none of this is an excuse for your physique. You&#39;re literally bony. Besides, your telepathy requires much higher energy input than average, and you don&#39;t even eat that much. How do you stay awake in the day? You hate coffee.</em> She takes in his scent and turns around. <em>If it&#39;s hard to be inherited and less fit, then any telepathy would be a result of mutation. But how many genes? Is this vestigial? Are we lucky to have it?</em></p><p>She remembers the day, when she was seven, she gathered her family to the living room.</p><p>&quot;Everyone, I have news.&quot; She said in a matter-of-fact tone. Her sisters, Mikaela and Ruth, six and four, sat up straight and looked at her with solemn eyes. Her parents grinned at each other. Looking around, she said syllable by syllable, &quot;I am telepathic.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; Mikaela asked.</p><p>&quot;I can read minds.&quot;</p><p>Her sisters&#39; eyes went wide with wonder.</p><p>&quot;Is that how you knew I wanted that barbie for my birthday?&quot; Mikaela shouted. Lindsay nodded. She also knew Mikaela and Ruth both snacked on the ice cream in the fridge in midnight last week, after everyone was asleep, but right now she doesn&#39;t want to distract her parents&#39; attention elsewhere.</p><p>Her father looked like he was bursting a rib from holding back laughter. He asked her what number he had in mind.</p><p>&quot;Infinity isn&#39;t a number, dad.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Okay then, that could be lucky.&quot; Her math professor father cracked up. &quot;Let&#39;s try again.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Can&#39;t you just play along?&quot; Her mother elbowed him, annoyed.</p><p>&quot;<em>I&#39;m</em> not playing, mom. Dad, this isn&#39;t a number either, you said so—&quot; Lindsay wasn&#39;t laughing the slightest when she wrote down <em>e__iπ</em> <em>+1 = 0</em>.</p><p>Her telepathy changed little for their daily lives if Lindsay ignored the fact that her father made it a habit to ask her to &quot;perform her psychic powers&quot; and start ranting off about some obscure math theory. She soon realized that while she could read their minds, her family couldn&#39;t hear hers. They couldn&#39;t even tell where the idea came from when she puts one into their minds. Once she came home with her mind blasting &quot;I got full marks on biology!&quot; at her mother, her mother asked what was she so happy about, &quot;Full marks in biology?&quot; She nodded, and her mother would laugh, &quot;See, I am telepathic, too!&quot; Another time when she had a fever and, dying of thirst, she sent her father calls for water. He did come with a glass of water, but upon entering he drained it in one swift movement as though in reflex. &quot;Oops, this was meant for you. I don&#39;t know why I keep drinking water even though I had a lot already.&quot; His apology was genuine. It was much later that she learnt from William his terms for these behaviors: &quot;Perception&quot;, the passive receiving of mental activities, and &quot;Injection&quot;, the ability to influence minds undetected.</p><p><em>Useless.</em> Lindsay thinks to herself. <em>Do I want to know that the Bergs think I&#39;ll be in their shoes with children a few years later, or that Mrs. Olsen thinks it&#39;s a waste of me not to have children?</em></p><p>Lindsay closes her eyes. <em>Well, I guess I&#39;m around that age…</em> The only topic they both avoid talking about. Last night was unusual and Lindsay was too preoccupied with Charlie&#39;s disappearance to notice which way the conversation was heading. <em>How can I miss it? The subject has been going on all day, every day, in fact, from that pick-up group to the neighbors to Tong.</em> She doesn&#39;t want to admit to herself her fear of giving birth, and less so as a developmental biologist. Talks of having children remind her immediately of the mandatory reactions and processes she studied reluctantly for a year. It sounds painful. It looks painful. Her professor had showed them a video of herself giving birth when Lindsay was still a graduate student. Lindsay still run into her on the campus sometimes, and when she does, she can&#39;t help avoiding eye contact.</p><p>William has his own reasons to avoid the topic, and she guesses it has something to do with his family. He doesn&#39;t hide his past, but when he spoke of it, he was always stoic, as though he was talking about someone else&#39;s life. <em>I wish I know what they really are.</em> She thinks, turning around and curling up around him. <em>I wish you know what&#39;s with me, too. Have you wondered—? I can&#39;t even bring myself to talk about it.</em> She finds herself kissing him. <em>If only we can read each other&#39;s mind.</em></p><p>Loneliness wells up in her, and she clasps William&#39;s hand. He wakes up.</p><p>&quot;Whassup? &#39;we late?&quot;</p><p>Lindsay wordlessly reaches over him into the nightstand drawer and fumbles around. In the dim light he sees her amber eyes on his, and her hairs around her thin, soft face, cheeks a little puffy from sleep, asking for something. He understands.</p><center>**</center><p>The dull dawn greets her as she walks out of the door. The world is drained of its color. William is shoveling the snow in Mrs. Olsen&#39;s yard. The old lady stands on the doorsteps in a red woolen shawl. Lindsay walks to the fence between their yards.</p><p>&quot;Have you any luck with Charlie?&quot; She is asking. William shakes his head, puffing. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, dear. Lindsay came to ask about him last night—oh, there she is. Good morning, dear!&quot; She nods and smiles, her face flushes with the cold, but her voice, though quivering with old age, brings warmth from her hearth.</p><p>&quot;Morning, Mrs. Olsen. Are you doing well?&quot; Lindsay says to the old lady, and then to herself, <em>Man, I really don&#39;t want to smile at you today, not after your fuss over children last night.</em></p><p>&quot;I am. Sorry that I have to borrow William for a moment, dear. The snow…&quot; Mrs. Olsen waves an arm at William carving away at the path to her door. Lindsay nods. Her neighbor goes on, &quot;William doesn&#39;t talk much, but he&#39;s a good boy…reminds me of one of my sons…&quot; Her two sons and a daughter all live and work in either Oslo or Drammen two hours away out in the south.</p><p>&quot;The boon of an introvert.&quot; Lindsay squeezes a swift smile out of a grimace. <em>Her sons and her daughter, her grandson and her granddaughters. Give me a break.</em></p><p>William grins at Mrs. Olsen, embarrassed, and calls to Lindsay, &quot;Be right there.&quot; He shoves the last few meters of snow with vigor, and lets out a long stream of breath. &quot;There,&quot; He looks up, &quot;take care walking out, ma&#39;am. Actually, <em>don&#39;t</em> walk out. Give me a call if you need anything. There are still bits of ice.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Thank you, William… Tell me,&quot; she looks first at him and then at Lindsay, and Lindsay sighs in her mind, <em>no…</em> &quot;What are your plans for Christmas?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Uh?&quot; William looks at her, eyes slightly narrowed. He perceives her plan of putting up a show of family love and egging them on with the matter of kids. &quot;Don&#39;t have any.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not going home?&quot; Mrs. Olsen peers at him. &quot;My children and my grandchildren will be coming over. Why don&#39;t you join us? We&#39;ll be making cakes—&quot;</p><p>Lindsay would&#39;ve just said she&#39;d think about it, but she sees William raises an eyebrow and tilts his head, putting on his sheepish good-boy smile. She recognizes the stance.</p><p>&quot;—but oh right, you&#39;re lactose intolerant and we must have milk to make cakes…&quot; Mrs. Olsen&#39;s face dropped. &quot;You can always skip that and go for the roasted chicken—&quot; William looks at his feet, smiling more. Mrs. Olsen falters &quot;—you&#39;re vegan, now I remember… Oh, I guess I should&#39;ve thought through this better! I&#39;m sorry!&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s alright. I appreciate the invitation, though.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We have to go. Take care, Mrs. Olsen!&quot; Lindsay steps back from the fence quickly and beckons to William. The old lady opens and then closes her mouth, and shuffles back into her house, confused. William walks back to Lindsay&#39;s side, smirking like an idiot.</p><p>&quot;<em>You&#39;re neither lactose intolerant nor a vegan!</em>&quot; Lindsay hisses when they get into the car. &quot;<em>Why did you do it?</em>&quot;</p><p>&quot;She&#39;s kind, but she always has her own agenda. Besides, she doesn&#39;t even know I influenced her.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Learn some tact and tell her you&#39;ll think about it, Will, instead of abusing your telepathy!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sensed her telling you what a waste it is for you not to have—&quot; William breaks off, &quot;Never mind.&quot;</p><p>Lindsay bits her lips and pretend not to have heard him.</p><center>**</center><p>In the late afternoon Lindsay brings one of the undergraduate student assistants over to her lab bench and says,</p><p>&quot;OK, quick technique lesson on executing mice.&quot;</p><p>Molly, the undergraduate nods, face calm. But she still asks,</p><p>&quot;For dissection?&quot;</p><p>&quot;That, and to prepare you for later things. People a floor above us use death as a means of control, stopping the brain activity at specific moments after treatment for comparison. For now, though, you&#39;ll be extracting the embryos for screening.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Um…&quot; Molly bites her lips and taking a long look in the cage on the lab bench. &quot;I…&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;ll be fast.&quot; Lindsay places a hand on the bench before Molly. &quot;You&#39;ll be doing dissections a lot next semester in the vertebrate morphology class, with larger mammals. Consider this a prep, okay?&quot; She winks and points to the cage. &quot;Here are the two mice. The way to do it is simple. Put the mouse over the edge of the cage like this… see, they&#39;ll grab it with their front paws. Now, take their tail in one hand and place a finger behind its head, just in the nook of the neck. You can feel it. Ready?&quot; She yanks briskly on the tail without even blinking. An inaudible <em>snap</em> whips the air. In her head she sees the light of life snaps out in the mouse&#39;s head. The mouse hangs limp and stretched between her hands like rubber. She lays the body on a plate behind her. &quot;Your turn.&quot;</p><p>Molly takes out the other mouse with deft hands, keeping the squealing rodent under control, and latches it onto the cage bar. She holds it like Lindsay showed her and tugs. The mouse flounders its hind paws in protest, squealing. Molly stands there frowning at the mouse, rocking on her feet.</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s hard at first for anyone. Do you want me to hold your hand through this one?&quot;</p><p>She shakes her head. She gives the tail a slow tug or two to brace for it. The mouse has stopped squealing, but just hangs there, waiting. The absentminded tugs go on but Molly can&#39;t seem to summon up the resolve.</p><p><em>This won&#39;t do.</em> Lindsay watches. The sophomore has all the intelligence and diligence for the developmental biologist that she wants to be, but the real initiation to the field is the ability to grit one&#39;s teeth and do what&#39;s necessary, like killing experimental animals. <em>I guess I&#39;ll have to do Injection…</em> Trying to shake off the guilt of breaching her own moral, Lindsay follows a stream of _I can&#39;t_s into Molly&#39;s mind, and repeated her recent memory of killing the mouse. With each re-enactment she changes the features of herself little by little, morphing her appearance until the girl executing the mouse is not Lindsay but Molly. The same girl in reality follows the course of the memory, pulls and throws the mouse into a fit of pain. She gasps and snatches her hand back. Lindsay decides to take over, convincing herself that doing so is for Molly&#39;s own good. Grabbing Molly&#39;s mind with her own Lindsay jerks her hand behind her back. The girl&#39;s hand yanks the tail in response. The mouse goes out like a bulb.</p><p>&quot;You did it.&quot; Lindsay pats her shoulder. &quot;Good job!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Not sure how I managed it, though.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;ll be easier next time.&quot; Lindsay smiles. &quot;Now, dissection…&quot;</p><p>They end a little before five. Molly bids her goodbye and leaves, looking much more relaxed. Lindsay collapses into a chair. Outside, the night is long fallen. She can only see the reflection of her lab in the window. From around the shelf of reagents William appears.</p><p>&quot;Who was that Brit girl again?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Molly Gordon. Did her first dissection just now.&quot; Lindsay looks at the floor. &quot;I had to Manipulate her with telepathy to kill it prior.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Guilty?&quot; William asks with a frown. They walk out of the lab.</p><p>&quot;Guilty. It&#39;s as if the sole use for being a telepath is to influence others…&quot;</p><p>They left together. Outside, in the horizon, a sliver of navy blue trims the heavy clouds that stretch over their heads against the dark sky, holding onto snow like a miser. Chimes of church bell floats over from the north, faint and solemn. William drives them down the campus hill, through the wet street lit by sparse lamps. The groups of children walking home are much quieter than yesterday, taking care not to slip. The life, the liveliness, like the lab mouse&#39;s mind, are out. Something nags Lindsay&#39;s mind. Charlie? A renewed sense of guilt floods down her face. She has not been thinking about the dog all day. No one contacted her or William from the flier they managed to put up last night, either.</p><p>&quot;No news from the animal shelter?&quot; She asks. He shakes his head.</p><p>&quot;Called them. No dogs came in all week. If Charlie isn&#39;t home today, we go look for him.&quot;</p><p>&quot;How?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Telepathy.&quot; William replies, rather embarrassed. &quot;I&#39;ve probed his thoughts once. He&#39;s definitely not always thinking of bones or walking around.&quot; Lindsay raises an eyebrow. &quot;I was curious. Have to say, I had to get much closer to his mind to read it. See, dogs are colorblind, but when I touched his mind, it&#39;s like I had never seen colors before… A collage of ideas and sensations—confusing—surreal—<em>overwhelming</em>. At some point I started to wonder: if we can find and learn this pattern, maybe we can talk to Charlie. Isn&#39;t this a great idea? But then again, is this specific to him, or is it for all dogs? Hey, do you think it&#39;d be easier to read dogs than other animals, since we co-evolved together?&quot;</p><p>Their car now sails through the busy downtown, joining other cars and buses, past neat rows of shops and restaurants lighting up the town in futility. Wreaths of mistletoe and early Christmas lights hide the yet-to-be-filled tables behind the windows.</p><p>&quot;Ironic, isn&#39;t it, that we can do so much with it.&quot; Lindsay&#39;s small smile at his excitement is ephemeral. She leans against the car window, voice quiet as though murmuring to herself. &quot;We can perceive thoughts, we can plant or even control ideas, we can do it to any living thing if we try, but we can&#39;t do it to each other.&quot; She holds out a hand before her, pressing the air. &quot;It&#39;s like we are separated by a sheet of glass.&quot; She looks at William&#39;s reflection. His face is impassive as usual. &quot;I see you, but I can&#39;t touch you. At least in your mirror metaphor, they can still interact, however futile.&quot; They have arrived home. Lindsay unlocks their front door. &quot;Not mine.&quot;</p><p>Darkness, warmth, and the still silence. Lindsay tries to sense for anything—any consciousness—in the house besides her own. Nothing. Her cellphone buzzes. She has not touched it all day. Below the new email about her bank statement is a message she missed. <em>Hi!</em> It says, <em>I saw your flier, and I saw your dog while taking my wife to the hospital yesterday. Saw him when we were parking there. A gold retriever, blue collar, white paws, long fur. It was following the road north. Hope this helps!</em> She replies her thanks and turns out of the door.</p><p>&quot;Where to?&quot; William asks.</p><p>&quot;Past the hospital up north.&quot;</p><center>**</center><p>The flier didn&#39;t show Charlie&#39;s collar, which is indeed blue, so Lindsay is confident about the lead. Though the sighting was &quot;yesterday&quot;, she tries not to lose hope. William drives slower than usual, so they can both scan the road for hints of their dog by sight as well as by telepathy, focusing on people&#39;s memories in the past two days and skimming through for signatures of dogs. They are crossing the line between the outer and the inner conscious, and Lindsay dislike taking such a drastic measure. It&#39;s equivalent to kicking down people&#39;s front doors and pulling open their drawers and wardrobes. She seeks comfort in the weak fact that they are leaving the bedroom door—the unconscious—alone.</p><p>&quot;If he was around the hospital… That&#39;s out of the neighborhood.&quot; William murmurs.</p><p>The mist clings on. Among the grayish blue or grayish yellow houses, Lindsay only perceives exhaustion and hunger. Memories not her own drift through her mind, and she sifts through them like one through another&#39;s diary. These people will believe they are recalling those memories out of their own free will. They won&#39;t know why they are trying to remember; they won&#39;t even feel her presence. She keeps reminding herself this, however futile it is against the truth that she&#39;s breaching her own moral rules twice in a day. She also tries to reach out to William. What is she expecting, really, other than the all-too-familiar sensation of an arrow veering smoothly off course? She knows where to reach out: it&#39;s the island in the sea of psychological activities, the silence in the background noise; yet as she reaches out towards it, she&#39;s repelled. <em>Just like magnets, south pole to south pole and north to north.</em> She gives up probing altogether. <em>Maybe Charlie doesn&#39;t like to wander around; it&#39;s us pushing him away, leaving the house for our nine-to-five job and going back again for another eight-to-ten… No, he started going off on his own before that, when we spent most of our time writing papers at home.</em></p><p>&quot;Why did we get a dog in the first place again?&quot; Lindsay isn&#39;t really asking.</p><p>&quot;We like dogs.&quot; He replies automatically.</p><p>&quot;Right.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Got anything?&quot;</p><p>Lindsay shakes her head, her thick ponytail and strands of her fly-away hair whipping the car window.</p><p>&quot;There&#39;s a guy calling his dad there about a dog, but not ours. Which reminds me,&quot; William stares ahead, &quot;Dad called after lunch.&quot; He watches a man walking his son, around six or seven, home. &quot;He was ranting again about my age and &#39;having an heir&#39;—&quot; <em>Heir,</em> Lindsay lists in her mind. <em>Son. Baby.</em> &quot;—Told him we got work, ourselves, and a dog to take care of. He tells me to shut up with my excuses.&quot; At that, an aloofness creeps into his eyes. Lindsay wonders if he had a feeling like missing a step when going downstairs when he heard that, like she does. But he speaks it; so he doesn&#39;t?</p><p>She reaches out for him. Repelled.</p><p>His father&#39;s right, though. Getting Charlie as an excuse to postpone the decision on children is the reason they both wish to deny. If they lose Charlie for good, their excuse for not having children against their parents&#39; incessant hinting and nagging is over. There&#39;s no way they will stop even if they get a new dog. William&#39;s father is already grudging against them having this one, if not against <em>her</em> for &quot;not shouldering her natural responsibility&quot; (or so he suggested to her once). Her own mother can&#39;t understand how having a dog can conflict with having a child. &quot;If it&#39;s financial issues, we can help!&quot; Lindsay smirks at this recollection. Did her mother help with her student loan? No.</p><p>In a yellow brick house under a red tiled roof up ahead Lindsay comes across the mind of a mother asking her 14-year-old daughter what she&#39;s so happy about. The girl says she made it into the cheerleader&#39;s squad. <em>Liar.</em> Lindsay thinks, amused. There&#39;s a much more important reason: being a cheerleader means she can get closer to the boy she likes on the soccer team. <em>Lady, even I know your daughter better than you do.</em> She tries at William again. <em>Futile.</em></p><p>&quot;There&#39;s an old couple who saw Charlie going north yesterday, in that house there. He should be going towards the hospital then.&quot; William whispers. &quot;We are on the right track.&quot;</p><p>The trees lining the street become thicker the further they go. Fuzzy orange orbs flare up between the bare branches, casting shadows that cobweb the ground. It&#39;s dinner time. Lindsay starts to smell their cooking from the minds she sifts through.</p><p>&quot;Are you hungry, Lin?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, are you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No. I&#39;ve been thinking…&quot; He hesitates. Lindsay tells him to go on with her eyes. &quot;Does it matter? Telepathy? So many families got along fine enough, and so do we.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don&#39;t you want to know the person you are giving your life to? It could&#39;ve been—It&#39;s <em>supposed</em> to be the most intimate way of communication between people…&quot;</p><p>&quot;True. There are no lies in telepathy. But we&#39;ve always been honest to each other.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yet there are things that words alone can&#39;t get through, things that are hard to even put into words.&quot; She adds to herself, <em>Like the discussion of having children between us, and your feelings about your family, and my fear of giving birth, and who knows what else you&#39;re hiding under there, like I am?</em></p><p>He doesn&#39;t respond.</p><p>They pass a wide street into a denser residential area. Around them, with people back in their homes, the town of Kanten comes alive. Pieces of Norwegian speech and clatter of forks against plates, sizzling water in oil and vented or ventless exhausts humming and churning, music from TV and computers and guitars and violins. Thus are the backgrounds of Kanten Av Skogen: the physical, the metaphysical, the mental. Its collective consciousness says <em>LIFE</em>: the mundane contradictions. Ice creams and hot pots; lights get flicked on and flipped off; the beauty and the ugliness. One family is in mourning of a deceased elder, its somber air challenged by another that&#39;s celebrating a toddler&#39;s birthday. In one passing house, a girl is spitting out spinach. In another, a boy is wolfing it down with relish. A couple is in tight embrace on the sofa, feeding each other dinner before TV. Another is fighting over a lipstick mark on a shirt collar, their dinner still frozen in the fridge. To the east Lindsay senses a homeless snoozing behind a trash bin in an alleyway, starving. Two blocks to his west William finds a man in suit-and-tie leaning at the foot of a telephone pole, wheezing from an asthma attack in the shadows.</p><p>&quot;We need to help him.&quot; William says, pointing in the direction. He senses a car driving up to the telephone pole, and he calls out to the driver&#39;s mind. &quot;Cold and the mist triggered it.&quot;</p><p>Mundane contradictions? Sure. Basic units of basic worlds colliding together to make the one world be. They can know what the entire city is doing if they wish to and react, yet they can&#39;t toward each other, or change their parents&#39; minds. William doesn&#39;t see his father in person and thus can&#39;t Inject. Lindsay tried with her mother but in the end couldn&#39;t bring herself to it. Are these mundane contradictions or some divine joke? Are they part of the basic units or the outliers? Are there somewhere in the world other telepath couples facing the same contradictions or are they connected as though they share a soul?</p><p>William slows down as a car speeds past them, its emergency lights flashing.</p><p>&quot;Our good Samaritan back there. The lady has an inhaler. The man&#39;ll be alright, I think—&quot;</p><p>A door slams in the darkness ahead and interrupts him. Through the mist comes roaring of a man. They both jerk their heads towards it: a family of three. The teenage daughter just came back smelling of tobacco and marijuana, and the father is demanding her whereabouts.</p><p>&quot;None of your business.&quot; Lindsay hears the girl snap in her mind. &quot;I got back here before 7, so there!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Smelling like you pickled yourself in the red lights district, and you think I&#39;ll just let it pass?&quot; The father pushes the girl back into a chair. They are speaking a Norwegian dialect, but Lindsay still understands due to her telepathy. &quot;Who were you with?&quot;</p><p>&quot;What&#39;s it to you? I&#39;ve had my fun and now I&#39;m back on time! What more do you want?&quot; The girl tries to push past but is barred down again.</p><p>&quot;Erik, calm down!&quot; The mother cries.</p><p>&quot;I did not raise our daughter to be a stoner and a whore!&quot;</p><p>They are approaching the household, and the shouting can be heard without telepathy. Instead their ability amplified the scraping of the chair on the floor, the smashing of mugs, a thump of a wallet against the sofa—</p><p>Lindsay feels six arms shoving, pushing, pulling, and wrestling. She doesn&#39;t know whose mind she is in anymore.</p><p>—bumps of a body thrown against the door, a whisk of a hand grabbing a broom up and a whack of another hand slapping it down—</p><p>The commotion and the anger make her heart race. A shiver of fear cut across them all. From whom?</p><p>&quot;—discipline!&quot;</p><p>&quot;—get off me, you motherfu—&quot;</p><p>A roar, the rattle of the door as the father and the daughter fights over the handle—</p><p>&quot;Erik!&quot;</p><p>A sound slap from both the house and her mind makes Lindsay recoil. She realizes the car has stopped, and turns to find William holding his left cheek, eyes wide with fire. She&#39;s almost scared to call him.</p><p>&quot;The girl saw Charlie last night.&quot; Comes his thick reply.</p><p>&quot;I—&quot;</p><p>&quot;It reminds me of my own beatings, that&#39;s all. Gimme a moment…&quot; He sits with his elbows propped on the wheel and rubs his face in his hands, trembling. His reality is punctured by the voice of his father saying, <em>responsibility to your old dad and your blood!</em> and recollection of his childhood scolds and beatings and his suppressed fury at his helplessness: fighting back would only get his more punishment. The scenes flashing past are covered by a veil of red. He does his best to prevent himself from becoming violent. A tiny part of him that&#39;s not compromised by the shock figures that it&#39;s only a result of close contact with the minds of that family: only a resonance of heightened emotions similar to what he had experienced. He tries to shut out the commotions from that family. The emotions will pass.</p><p>At last, he sees himself screaming at his father, &quot;<em>Responsibility to hell, you who are absent most of</em> my <em>life!</em>&quot; and his grandmother banging the table at his father, &quot;<em>Get OUT, you! Let the boy eat his meal! Don&#39;t tell</em> me <em>how to raise my grandson!</em>&quot; The yells echo and die. The wheel, the seat, the car, and Lindsay&#39;s hand on his arm bloom back to existence.</p><p>&quot;Did I just experience PTSD without trauma?&quot; He gives a hollow laugh. &quot;Ow. It hurts, Lin.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Your knuckles are white.&quot; Lindsay doesn&#39;t let go of him, and wonders how he can laugh it off like that and what he saw. &quot;Can you still drive? What did you see?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;ll tell you when we&#39;re home.&quot; He nods and drives on.</p><p>A few blocks later, a five-story building sprawls along the parking lot on their left, the red-bordered white cross at its top blurry in the air. The car slows to a halt at the side of the road. Lindsay sensed a few people in the hospital. One of the front desk assistants saw Charlie early in the morning, heading further north. The man who sent Lindsay the message is there, too, pacing head down on the third floor. Beside him are two anxious old people sitting on a bench. A bit further to their right stand a group of five bending over a woman—</p><p><em>Third floor, the obstetrics department?</em> Lindsay freezes. Her mind falls right into the laboring woman&#39;s mind like iron to a magnet. The contact makes her squeeze her eyes shut. She can&#39;t back out. Rhythmic and lingering pain work their ways through telepathy into her mind and creeps down her body. When she opens her eyes they are not her own but the woman&#39;s. Five people in blue crowds by her crotch in a well-lit room. She shrinks away from them but her legs remain open and outstretched.</p><p>&quot;Okay… push. Push! C&#39;mon…&quot; She hears through the woman&#39;s ears, too. She gasps the woman&#39;s gasps. Pain. &quot;Yes, that&#39;s it, again! Okay… Again!&quot;</p><p>The pain is becoming acute with each expansions and contractions. She&#39;s being ripped apart and it doesn&#39;t stop there. The wife chants feverishly to herself, <em>I&#39;m going to die I&#39;m going to die I&#39;m going to die</em>, and Lindsay echoes, <em>make it stop make it stop oh mom get me out of her!</em> To her horror, her memory of her mother replies, <em>it&#39;ll be over soon, honey. You&#39;ll love what comes out of it later.</em> A new stroke of pain splits her from head to foot and she can&#39;t tell who&#39;s screaming. Sweat is rolling down her head, and it hurts—her mind hurts. She can&#39;t back out no matter how much she tries. She&#39;s digging her nails into the bed sheet and her thighs, unable to tear anything apart.</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s out. The head. You two, birth assist. Get ready. Easy—&quot;</p><p>Gloved hands thrust into her and she gasps in shock. Another pair rubs her belly. Somewhat surreal, she feels yet another pair wraps around her shoulder in another body. They all pull. Lindsay—or the woman—struggles to keep the contraction at bay and to remain conscious, forcing down screams. A sensation of relief bursts as the baby comes through. Like plug out of a drain Lindsay jerks and find herself sweating and gasping and crying in William&#39;s arms, curled into a ball, her whole body in spasms. Her first reaction is to feel between her legs to make sure nothing triggered her period early. <em>Good. Nothing.</em></p><p>&quot;I&#39;m here, dear. I&#39;m here.&quot; William strokes her hair. &quot;We&#39;re both here, Lin. It&#39;s alright. I thought I lost you.&quot; He&#39;s sweating, too. There was nothing he could do to help.</p><p>&quot;How long was I out?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No idea. What was it? That woman?&quot; He strokes her head, and she grits her teeth, trying not to cry more.</p><p>Darkness outside. Orange fuzzy light. Dim outlines of trees and cars and buildings. Warm air from the AC. These things the woman on the third floor in the hospital cannot see and needs not to see. She takes comfort in her newborn, not in the world. Lindsay stays curled in William&#39;s arms for a long time, sweating and trembling, thinking of nothing.</p><center>**</center><p>At last she lets out,</p><p>&quot;Let&#39;s keep going,&quot; and he doesn&#39;t protest.</p><p>Misty shadows of the trees climb over their windshield and houses fall back, but Lindsay isn&#39;t scanning them anymore. They have lost Charlie already, she&#39;s sure. There&#39;s something they have to discuss, more urgent than their lost dog, and more important than philosophizing a perhaps vestigial trait. They can&#39;t avoid the topic any longer. The road runs past the last houses and into the muffled woods. It ends in a pebbly clearing served as a parking lot. A lonely lamp throws a dim glow into nowhere.</p><p>Lindsay leans over and gives William a long kiss. She musters up the strength to whisper, &quot;Be back soon,&quot; and staggers out of the car and into the woods.</p><p>What can William say? Lindsay&#39;s hair is undone; either she didn&#39;t notice or she doesn&#39;t care. He waits until the swishing gold and her small form dissolves in the darkness ahead before shedding his glasses and collapsing onto the wheel, drawing out a long, muffled scream. His left cheek still tinged. It took his all to make light of the encounter with the family, not to mention to continue driving. He&#39;s used to keeping down the pain inside; he doesn&#39;t want to disappoint. Still, William is grateful for her to give him some moments to succumb. <em>I wish I could tell her this, but there&#39;s no way for it to come out right. Yes, she&#39;s right. Telepathy would make this much easier.</em></p><p>If only there&#39;s a way to reach her mind and dump everything he can&#39;t put into words in there, and vice versa. But they are mirrors; all they can share through telepathy is the solitude of being telepaths, the glaring fact that they can read everyone else but no one can read them, not even one another. That was how he knew <em>what</em> she was but not <em>who</em> she was the first time they met. He couldn&#39;t overlook how her mind repelled his. It was at that moment when he understood despair: the unending and persistent tunnel that bounces between the mirrors, the knowledge that he would never learn the girl sitting before him as well as he can with any other people. The thrill of finding someone who is what he is? Drowned in that tunnel. He had long stopped trying to probe her mind, tired and afraid of the futility. He&#39;s lucky to have met her. It has been too lonely. Perhaps in the past, telepaths were driven mad in the end, and few had descendants. The mental impacts, the energy consumption, the limited social function—all of these point to the ill fitness of telepathy. Yet it resurfaces throughout history, and no doubt admired by many, enshrined in science fictions as the ultimate evolution. <em>How boring would that be, though, everyone being telepathic.</em> He wipes his eyes and resettles his glasses. Folding his arms on top of the wheel and resting his chin on them, he stared beyond the reach of the lamp.</p><p>There is something more pressing than the whereabouts of Charlie right now—something they have been avoiding to discuss. Charlie is as good as gone, and William forces himself to accept that. This creates a new reason with which their parents can use to pressure them about having kids. There is no excuse for him and Lindsay to avoid the talk anymore. Should they have one, when should they have one, how to face the pressure. He knows that he can&#39;t be a good parent, lacking one himself. If they had a kid, what if he becomes that father they encountered earlier, and the kid that daughter? Even if they don&#39;t, will he be any better than him, or any one of his parents? Maybe he&#39;ll try to do what his grandmother did for him, cooking and asking about the day… but he never gave her any trouble. If his child does, will he resort to verbal and physical violence? It&#39;s his greatest fear, and he is not certain that he won&#39;t. He does wonder, as an amusing thought, whether their kid will also be a telepath…</p><p>Maybe he should go find her. He wants to hear what Lindsay has to say. No. He wants to <em>feel</em> it. Whenever she looks moody or in pain, he wants to share whatever she&#39;s feeling, and bear it with her. He wonders whether ordinary people have this constant need to feel and to understand. How do they deal with it? Perhaps they don&#39;t, and are content with the negativity. Or perhaps they do, and yearn for telepathy.</p><p>Maybe it&#39;s just the Law of the World that two people can never know each other well, not even telepaths, and such is one of those mundane contradictions. The girl who hates spinach and the boy who loves it, the healthy beggar and the ill office clerk, the two people who can perceive everyone else&#39;s thoughts except each other&#39;s—all of these contradictory units form the world. Perhaps the mirror metaphor itself is one of these contradictions, that the mirrors are in essence the same: when facing each other they see each other, and themselves, over and over again, stretching way deep into each other.</p><p><em>Should I take comfort in that?</em> The image of Lindsay curled up, trembling and gasping in pain and eyes wide with fear, burns in his mind eye. <em>Perhaps what we feel might not be so different? Still, the next time she feels pain, I want to know. I want to share the burden.</em> Outside, a snowflake, big as a feather, lands and shrinks on the windshield, followed by another and another. His stomach growls. <em>We&#39;re eating out tonight, I guess. Come back soon.</em></p><center>**</center><p>Black branches crisscross above like spokes of wheels. No moon. No stars. Nothing. Maybe a few minds of elks? No dogs. Not even wolves. Lindsay realizes her hair is undone at some point near the hospital. <em>Doesn&#39;t matter. My neck&#39;ll be warmer.</em> She thinks.</p><p>Each of her uneven steps get stronger than the last, but her head still throbs. Small tremors crawl through her skin. The pain between her legs is a little tough to ignore. So these, all of these, she will <em>love</em> it? Her mother has been suggesting to her ever since Mikaela had her baby. &quot;Look at him,&quot; she cooed at her grandson during their last video chat. &quot;Say hi to auntie! Lindsay, you&#39;ll know when you have yours. You&#39;ll <em>love</em> it.&quot; Had this been in person, she might understand her mother better. But through a screen, she could only frown.</p><p>She emerges from the trees, twenty or so meters from her is the shore of a lake. She can hardly see the water. It&#39;s cold but windless. Lindsay slides down to the foot of the closest tree, and squeezes her legs together. <em>It still hurts.</em> Funny her father never nagged her about children. <em>Could it be guilt? After some years he finally knew what he put mom through three times? Or that he realized three was too many?</em> How horrible, to be ripped open like that. The blood, the pain… The worst thing was that there was no one with whom to share. Does she want him to feel it? How? By having William stab himself with a knife when she&#39;s in labor? By those stupid devices they use to let the fathers have a taste of a tenth of the pain the mothers are feeling? By her telepathy?</p><p>Her telepathy, either the mundane contradiction or the divine irony that tops the rest—is it a blessing or a curse? She can&#39;t understand how a trait that can set two people so far apart even exist. When William is going through whatever he was going through back with that family, she could do nothing but watch. Her touch had no effect neither on his pain nor her attempts at telepathy. He says he&#39;ll tell her, but what will be omitted through words? One can struggle to find the right words yet still get not a fraction of her meaning across. Perhaps no one in the world can understand another person as thoroughly as understanding oneself. <em>Or perhaps we aren&#39;t so different—I couldn&#39;t share his pain entirely, nor can he mine back at the hospital. Small comfort in negativity.</em> William&#39;s face blooms into her mind. <em>I&#39;d like to know how you managed to joke and kept on driving after that, though. You always do, masking annoyance after your dad calls or sadness after your mom messages with a poker face. Don&#39;t hide from me, please, and I&#39;ll promise that I won&#39;t hide myself from now on.</em></p><p>Lindsay feels the pain finally subsides. She raises and steps just to the edge of the lake. She can see nothing other than a faint outline stretching from before her feet to her left and right, and the mist blurs even that. She calls for Charlie in her mind, and then again out loud. Nothing. Her voice is lost fast around her, leaving not even an echo. <em>This is it.</em> She looks ahead. <em>The excuse they need. &quot;You&#39;ll probably lose the next dog, too, so better hurry up and have a real child that you sure will look after better.&quot;</em></p><p>They can&#39;t avoid the subject any longer. Charlie is gone. When their parents learn of it they&#39;ll pounce on it, especially William&#39;s father. <em>That man… he has some ideology issues about genders. Is he really a biologist?</em> She needs to talk to William—what do they want, when do they want it, how to deal with the pressure. <em>I also want to know his reasons for avoiding this. I&#39;ll tell him mine.</em> Looking down, she imagines the black water reflecting faces of William&#39;s father, her mother, and Mrs. Olsen. &quot;This is our own business. You stay—&quot; Ignoring a pang of hunger, she stomps into the water. &quot;—out of it!&quot;</p><p>She backs off and watch flakes of snow, large as feathers, starting to join the water in ripples.</p>]]></content>

      &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Do you think he&amp;#39;ll be home when we get back?&amp;quot; Lindsay asks behind the wheels. Cars glide through the streets of Kanten Av Skogen before her in the long Scandinavian winter night, the noise of their engines muffled by the thin mist flooding the town. Early Scandinavian winter brings an early evening; only a layer of glass keeps the chill at bay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;He will. Don&amp;#39;t worry. Charlie always comes back from his wanderings before six. He&amp;#39;s smart even for a dog.&amp;quot; William soothes her.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Lao Wang woke to an infant dawn, hiding behind the curtains. Light snuck its way onto his wrinkled face through the gap, which he turned to his decade-old alarm clock first, then to the curtains, and finally to the metal heater at the foot of his bed. Dressing took him less than ten minutes: after his wife passed away almost two years ago, he had kept his clothes on the empty side of the bed instead of on the heater—a mere substitute of what was lost, even if it meant for him starting his winter days cold.</p><p>For the past two weeks, Lao Wang has broken out of his morning routine of curtains, bathroom, wash, and breakfast. He went straight to the foot of his bed, and squatted down to stroke Coco, his Chinese rural dog. The mud-yellow fur was stiff and the body was lukewarm. She slept on her side in the many-layered nest, breathing way too shallow for Lao Wang&#39;s liking. Coco hadn&#39;t moved much for two weeks and Lao Wang felt that it would be any day now. He went to pour milk into one of her bowls and filled up the other with chow.</p><a id="more"></a><p>&quot;Stay with me, Coco.&quot; He murmured, stroking her head. &quot;Stay with me.&quot;</p><p>In the bathroom, the sensors on the toilet directed the seat to warm up to forty degrees Celsius fifteen seconds before Lao Wang entered, and the light went on ten seconds after the seats. As usual, when he turned to flush, Lao Wang instead found himself frowning at a screen displaying analysis of his contents. The lid was already closing and the toilet flushed itself. The mirror tried to tell Lao Wang the temperature of the day, along with humidity, air pressure, UV index, and air quality. &quot;Go away, damn it.&quot; Lao Wang muttered. His son, Xiao Wang, would have added a news module to it had he not threw a fit: &quot;As if I need to waste more time in the bathroom!&quot;</p><p>Lao Wang looked at his reflection. It was a face he recognized but didn&#39;t fully identify with. Wrinkled, thin face, white hairs and high hair lines, dim eyes made bigger by his frame shrunken by age. A few dark spots here and there; thankfully, no hairy warts. He couldn&#39;t believe he was seventy-three. Seventy-three—old age had never been something that bothered him much in his youth. He was a programmer by trade, and whiled away most of his days beside a computer and a keyboard. Before his fortieth birthday, Lao Wang decided that his whole life would be coding and his offspring would only be his programs. He took pride in his one-line codes in java and the first cries of &quot;Hello World&quot; from his programs and apps. He thought he&#39;d grow old only when his programs stop producing bugs. But, Lao Wang reflected as he turned on the gas stove (the AI somewhere in the kitchen turned on the exhaust), before he knew it, he got married.</p><p>&quot;Must be the weather.&quot; Lao Wang muttered, shaking away the dark thoughts. He swallowed a spoonful of porridge. Artsy and sentimental were never among words that people used to describe him. Today, Lao Wang couldn&#39;t help but feel that way. &quot;Must be old age.&quot; He muttered after another spoonful.</p><p>Dawn was now trying to push aside the curtain. In the muffled light, Lao Wang finished his breakfast and went to crouch down beside his dog.</p><p>&quot;Coco, Coco.&quot; He called.</p><p>The old dog was still.</p><p>&quot;Wake up, will you?&quot;</p><p><em>Oh dear</em>. He thought. He stroked her again. The warmth that was there was evaporating.</p><p>&quot;Wake up, old girl.&quot; He never thought he could sound so desperate and useless. &quot;Coco?&quot; He remembered how unambiguous his wife had died—there was no mistaking the straight line on the cardiograph and the limp hand sliding out of his grasp. &quot;Coco?&quot;</p><p>The automatic curtains chose this moment to move. Thick brown fabrics glided silently aside in their electromagnetic grooves and light squeezed into every room of Lao Wang&#39;s apartment that it can reach. The magnificence spread over Coco&#39;s body and drowned Lao Wang.</p><p>The old man was no longer crouching. He slumped against the wall in the pool of light, one hand still on his dog&#39;s head.</p><center> ** </center><p>&quot;Dad?&quot; Xiao Wang&#39;s voice soothed Lao Wang a little through the phone. Xiao Wang worked in a prominent state-owned technology company. Most of his time was spent on either coding or fiddling around cutting-edge technology. Lao Wang could understand his talks of virtual reality and augmented reality at first. Later ones about artificial intelligence training, organism memory-digital data transcoding, and even inventions of new programming languages were beyond him. It had always been his wife calling their son, and Lao Wang picked the habit up after her passing, on a lower frequency. Sometimes he checked on Xiao Wang&#39;s life, but at other times, he just wanted to talk. &quot;Dad? What&#39;s up?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, not much. Just wanted to check on you.&quot; Lao Wang replied.</p><p>&quot;Not bad—my department is finalizing the last syntaxes for this language we&#39;re inventing. Remember, dad? The one that we dubbed &#39;Byron&#39;? Now, we&#39;ve managed to make it four times more versatile…&quot;</p><p>Lao Wang let him speak, understanding little, at best. <em>Better hear about the boy&#39;s jargons than thinking about Coco</em>, he thought. He &quot;oh&quot;ed and &quot;ah&quot;ed where he could.</p><p>&quot;…and guess what we call he test program? C&#39;mon dad, take a guess.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What, not &#39;Hello World&#39; anymore?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Much better: &#39;Hello, Mad Psychotic World&#39;! Haha!&quot; Xiao Wang seemed to have dropped the phone in excitement. &quot;I wish you could see it, dad—didn&#39;t I tell you about the program, ARt?&quot; —Lao Wang remembered that during one rare visit from his son last month, he showed him a communication program that can project a person&#39;s surroundings to his interlocutor— &quot;We should use it right now, so you can see the test program!&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, I&#39;m sure you can show me the next time you visit.&quot; Lao Wang wondered if he should tell Xiao Wang about Coco soon.</p><p>&quot;Oh… sure!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Coco died, you see.&quot; It was some time before Lao Wang spoke again. &quot;This morning, or maybe over the night.&quot;</p><p>&quot;What? Dead? I&#39;m sorry, dad.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Can you come over after work today? Or over the weekend?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Um, that&#39;s one thing I couldn&#39;t do, you see… as I said, we&#39;re finishing up the project… it&#39;s near the end of the year, too, the progress is looking good, and I happened to be the lead program engineer, so, uh…&quot; His son&#39;s genuine apologetic tone sounded lame to Lao Wang. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, dad.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Alright then.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hey, let me make up for that, alright, dad? The AI department here had a breakthrough. See, they managed to replicate a dog&#39;s conscious with their program.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Wouldn&#39;t I just buy a new, organic dog if I need one?&quot; Lao Wang mumbled. &quot;Are you trying to find them a beta tester?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh? You&#39;ll be the first <em>owner</em>! <em>I</em> was one of the beta testers. It&#39;ll be fine—they&#39;ve even hooked up with the robotics department and made its vector look and work like a real dog. It&#39;s brilliant. I can ask them to make it look like Coco, and mail it over. It&#39;ll be fast, since we&#39;re in the same city.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Fine.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sorry that I couldn&#39;t make it, dad. Uh… consider the dog me in the meantime.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m not sure I want to think that way, you know? Having a dog for a son?&quot;</p><p>&quot;There&#39;s always Lunar New Year. I <em>always</em> come home for Lunar New Year.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Right.&quot; <em>Probably the only time other than my birthday you are guaranteed to come.</em> Lao Wang thought. &quot;Well, get back to work, you; don&#39;t let me keep you.&quot;</p><p>Lao Wang wasn&#39;t the type of parent who used himself as examples for his children, but he couldn&#39;t help remembering the times when he was young. He had always tried to find time to visit <em>his</em> parents, even on the nights around November 11^th, when &quot;Double Eleven&quot;-shoppers bombarded the servers he was taking care of. He had never been a lead programmer though, so he couldn&#39;t talk about being busy.</p><p>The sofa next to the phone faced a TV, and above it hang the wedding photo of Lao Wang and his wife thirty-three years ago. It was this that he rested his eyes on. The color was still vibrant behind the glass pane. His younger self stood in a full black suit, sporting a smart haircut and an embarrassed smile. His hooked nose and square jaw were highlighted by the sun. He looked much younger than forty. He was resting his forehead on hers. His wife&#39;s hair was tied up into a high bun, following the customs of the day. Long strands curled down the sides of her thin and smooth face, down to her pointed chin. Her usually big eyes were squinting with laughter. Her wedding dress matched the white seagulls in the background. It was a late spring day.</p><p>Lao Wang allowed himself indulge in the photo for another second, and called up his friend, Lao Chen, to borrow a shovel for Coco&#39;s burial.</p><center> ** </center><p>It was an unremarkable grave. Lao Wang picked the spot only because it was within view of his balcony: that fir tree on the side of the hill behind his home. The hill was part of a park, so Lao Wang went well off-road for the grave.</p><p>&quot;Look, you can see your balcony from here, but you can&#39;t pick out here from your balcony.&quot; Lao Chen said. He was an ex- fellow co-programmer living in the building next to Lao Wang. &quot;I was hoping for a better reason, even if it&#39;s &#39;good <em>FengShui</em>&#39;.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s <em>my</em> dog we&#39;re burying here, Lao Chen. You can bury yours wherever you want next time.&quot;</p><p>It was the third day of the burial. The soil on the grave was still black and a little wet. The day was rather pleasant: warm for December, and clear. A group of old women climbed the steps well away, but their voice pierced through trees, singing old songs from Lady Gaga. It stopped when one of them shrieked,</p><p>&quot;Hey look! Is that a delivery drone?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Why, it is!&quot; yelled another.</p><p>&quot;Are they finally deploying them for commercial uses? After 50 years?&quot; shouted yet another.</p><p>&quot;Whoever gets that is lucky, no doubt.&quot; said the first one.</p><p>&quot;Lucky, my hat.&quot; Lao Chen nudged Lao Wang. &quot;The receiver just lost his dog. It&#39;s going toward your balcony, Lao Wang!&quot;</p><p>Sure enough, Lao Wang saw a drone carrying an oblong box making a beeline at his balcony. No one in their right mind would use a drone for delivery, unless they were rich and tech-savvy. He knew what was in there.</p><center> ** </center><p>It wasn&#39;t that the robot dog didn&#39;t look like the real Coco; what bothered Lao Wang was the fact that it was a _robot_—one with cutting-edge technology inside its head, another symbol of the fast-changing world that his son had more or less forced into his life, while keeping himself out of it.</p><p>It was two days after the robot&#39;s arrival. Lao Chen came to visit again.</p><p>&quot;Damn dog your son got you here. It&#39;s a perfect replica.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Only in looks it&#39;s perfect.&quot; Lao Wang said, watching Lao Chen playing with it. Indeed it was so. The robot came with the same mud-yellow coat as the original, with the same dark, glassy eyes and a long snout. It even had the white patch of furs on its lower jaw.</p><p>Lao Chen flipped it over and rubbed its belly. It squinted its eyes and wagged out its tongue. He tutted.</p><p>&quot;Damn good make here, Lao Wang. Look at those teeth they made. You sure you weren&#39;t fooling me about Coco being dead?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Your tongue runs on as ever,&quot; came the stiff reply. Lao Wang sat crouching on the sofa, elbows on thighs and eyebrows on top of each other.</p><p>&quot;What&#39;s up? Your son&#39;s an accomplished man, and you&#39;re benefiting as his dad. I&#39;d be twice as happy if my two kids brought home half as many high-tech gadgets your son did, even if they don&#39;t have a hand in the program codes.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You can take the mirror, toilet, stove, and curtains home anytime.&quot; Lao Wang growled. The robot dog rolled out from under Lao Chen&#39;s hands and padded over, poking its snout into Lao Wang&#39;s hands. It was Coco&#39;s signature move. Lao Wang didn&#39;t respond, but wondered instinctively how the AI learnt so much in so short a time: had his son been training it all along, preparing for this day? How did his son log in all of his habits, then? Lao Wang looked around in alarm.</p><p>&quot;Wha-? Lao Wang, what are you doing?&quot; Lao Chen stood up, and then sat down on the sofa as a momentary dizziness hit him. When the black spots faded, he saw his friend taking apart the wedding photo&#39;s frame. Then he watched him taking apart the clock on the wall, banging at the heater pipes, and pulling out cushions on the sofas. The robot dog bounded in excitement after him. Lao Chen decided to stop his home-demolition when Lao Wang tried to climb onto the wide windowsill. &quot;Damn, old man, what are you doing?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Help me pull down that curtain! I need to look at the rod.&quot;</p><p>&quot;For what?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hidden cameras!&quot;</p><p>&quot;What&#39;s gotten into you, man?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don&#39;t you think it&#39;s too fast for an AI to learn Coco&#39;s behaviors in less than four days, when it took AlphaGo <em>months</em> to beat the world champion?&quot;</p><p>The two old men stared at each other.</p><p>&quot;That was four decades ago.&quot; Lao Chen said blankly.</p><p>They stared at each other some more.</p><p>&quot;Get down here!&quot; Lao Chen barked. Lao Wang slowly complied. &quot;Why would you think your own son needed to surveil you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;How did this AI learn so fast, then? From where?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Your son&#39;s own memory? Weren&#39;t you complaining about some memory-reader he was working on some months ago?&quot; Lao Chen saw the other scowl at the floor, a hand scratching the robot&#39;s head. &quot;So what are you calling it?&quot; He jutted his chin at the robot. Lao Wang&#39;s hand snapped back.</p><p>&quot;Nothing.&quot; He mumbled.</p><p>&quot;Why not just &#39;Coco&#39;?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Don&#39;t feel like it.&quot;</p><p>They sat in silence for a moment until Lao Chen couldn&#39;t stand it anymore.</p><p>&quot;Ah-aye! Forget about it all. Get out your chess board. Let&#39;s play chess. Play chess!&quot; He waved his hand, irritated.</p><center> ** </center><p>Lao Wang saw his friend off in better spirits despite losing 2-4. He decided to take the dog (<em>—robot—</em>) out for a walk. The mirror reminded him his face mask in this weather, and he leashed up the robot. Lao Wang hadn&#39;t done that for the original Coco for years, but he felt obligated for the robot.</p><p>The grey smog wasn&#39;t too horrible. A northwest wind was blowing, and Lao Wang knew it meant more smog was on the way. He walked with the dog in tow, passing tall apartments. The sidewalk was splattered with dirty marks despite the street sweepers and their robots.</p><p>&quot;You know,&quot; he peered at the robot dog, who looked up as Coco would do, &quot;ten years ago they installed robots to replace the street sweepers. Real bulks of metal, those robots, nothing like you or the ones over there.&quot; He indicated those white hovering boxes with arms attached. &quot;They had hoped to cut down labor cost. Turned out the cost saved was poured back into robotic maintenance—hey, stop it!&quot; The robot dog was snigging at random tree trunks and pole bases, and was now crouching down to pee. &quot;I thought only male dogs have territorial behaviors? Something wrong with your AI?&quot;</p><p>A few passersby glanced at him with sympathy. Lao Wang ignored them and tugged at the leash.</p><p>&quot;As I was saying, the government spent millions in maintenance and rehabilitation of the laid-off sweepers. Later they spent yet more on replacing stolen robots. Can you believe people steal robot sweepers, dog? To sell the metal and modules for money?&quot;</p><p>The robot looked back, tongue out, as though smiling. Lao Wang turned to look at the buildings instead. These towering apartments looked just like the one he lived in, painted one yellow vertical stripes between two grey ones. Every window was encased in a stainless steel, anti-burglar cages.</p><p>&quot;Look at them, dog. Those cages has been around for more than fifty years and people started to un-see them. Visual fatigue. Know why we don&#39;t have them around our window, dog?&quot; Lao Wang lowered his head and voice, &quot;Because <em>we</em> got anti-burglar defense that zaps!&quot; He straightened up again. &quot;They don&#39;t have a son who sends all sorts of high-tech things to them except himself, either.&quot;</p><p>The park looked desolate. A red cloth banner saying &quot;Increase sports activities / Enhance people&#39;s health&quot; flapped frail in the wind. A few people were out at the stone tables playing chess or cards. They called out to Lao Wang.</p><p>&quot;Your dog looks livelier today, Lao Wang.&quot; One remarked.</p><p>&quot;Yes, yes. Terminal Lucidity, I&#39;m afraid.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Didn&#39;t you bury something the other day?&quot; Another asked.</p><p>&quot;That was somebody else&#39;s.&quot;</p><p>&quot;How&#39;s your son? Working hard as usual?&quot; chimed in yet another.</p><p>&quot;As usual.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Come on over for a match.&quot; Said the first one again.</p><p>&quot;Another time.&quot;</p><p>They waved Lao Wang goodbyes and left him on his way.</p><p>The only appliance of his intelligent stove that Lao Wang liked and used was the fanless exhaust. It adjusted the intake according to the environment in a snap. Lao Wang and his wife hated a fumy kitchen, and the place being long and narrow didn&#39;t help.</p><p>Lao Wang stood there dicing meat. He recalled when his wife was still alive. They always cooked together. The kitchen was crowded with two people already, and sometimes more so with their son and later Coco barging in because of the smell. They didn&#39;t talk too much during cooking, but Lao Wang felt that the sound of knives against the cutting board and the two of them cooperating flawlessly were good enough. It made the narrow kitchen cozy.</p><p>The robot Coco came into the kitchen, wagging its tail. It laid two paws onto the counter.</p><p>&quot;Get off. I&#39;ll feed you later.&quot; Lao Wang waved at it.</p><p>The kitchen was way too empty now. He wondered if things would be better if Xiao Wang was back living with him. The youth didn&#39;t have any dates yet, after all. Besides, they had good times cooking together when Xiao Wang was still in college. They could still chat now, even though Lao Wang couldn&#39;t understand half of what he said…</p><p>&quot;Get away from the microwave, there. It&#39;s bad for your health—I mean, your circuits.&quot; Lao Wang called out to the robot. &quot;Come here, dog—I mean—&quot; How do you address it, really? He thought furiously and held the robot up. It was warm and soft like the real thing. Lao Wang stuffed a piece of meat into its jaws and sent it on its way out. Its internal mechanisms would take care of the meat and its energy. He was reluctant to name it at all. Robotic dogs were to him always white polygons whose nose fires up when they &quot;bark&quot;. This one he had was too real; yet he couldn&#39;t look past the knowledge of its robotic origin.</p><center> ** </center><p>The thing that Lao Wang was reluctant to admit: he got used to the robot Coco. It took only a week for him to return to his &quot;curtains-bathroom-wash-breakfast&quot; morning routine.</p><p>The thing that Lao Wang was quick to admit but reluctant to praise: the robot Coco was, in quite a literal sense, artificially intelligent. He had never trained the original Coco systematically; whatever manners and help she had or had given were results of year-long learning and hundreds of &quot;no&quot;s and &quot;don&#39;t&quot;s. Lao Wang didn&#39;t know what type of memories his son had used to train the robot dog, but he was sure that, when it first arrived, it couldn&#39;t and didn&#39;t pad over, late at night, to nuzzle him about bedtime when he was engrossed in parsing out the latest tech report; nor did it knew what he was looking for when he misplaced his glasses in the first two days. Lao Wang knew that AI could learn and improve, but it couldn&#39;t &quot;forget&quot; and then &quot;remember&quot;, so to speak. There was no way to make some pre-learnt function dormant, ignoring all the stimulants, and then trigger until time was ripe. In a word, the robot dog was learning manners and behaviors on-the-go. It amazed Lao Wang by how much it surpassed the original in two mere weeks.</p><p>The thing that Lao Wang was uncomfortable about: the robot dog seemed almost human.</p><p>During their walks, Lao Wang passed Coco&#39;s grave often. The dirt was no longer black or fresh, and vegetative debris were starting to cover it. For the first few times, Lao Wang just stood there, lost in thought beside the fir tree. The robot dog wandered about. On later visits, when he pulled himself out of reverie, he found the robot at times standing there in mid-wander, observing him, carrying on only after it saw him move, as if affirming his living state. At last, one day, Lao Wang found it sitting next to his feet, looking up as if in question.</p><p>&quot;Here lies your predecessor, Coco.&quot; was all he said.</p><p>The robot gave the patch a wistful look, and back at Lao Wang. It was a windy and frostbitten mid-December day, and Lao Wang couldn&#39;t stand the slicing wind now that he took notice of it. He pulled up his scarf and turned to go, but the robot dog went and laid down over the grave. Lao Wang thought he noticed a bug in the programming here: a real dog wouldn&#39;t have done that in the cold, even if they had heavy coats to cushion the underbelly. But why did it do that? Had it understood and strung together words of &quot;lies&quot;, &quot;predecessor&quot;, and &quot;Coco&quot;? Did it understood that this was a grave of significance? The robot gave a sudden bark, and Lao Wang looked around in alarm. Nothing was there. It gave a few more barks and a long howl, and he realized that it was mourning. The robot dog had never barked before, not even when other, real dogs harassed it. Its first cries were for mourning. Lao Wang then remembered further that, on one of the visits to his mother&#39;s grave, his son was equally silent, kneeling before the grave. It was a full five minutes before Xiao Wang cried out &quot;Mom! Mom!&quot; and started wailing.</p><p>Lao Wang wasn&#39;t sure how to feel.</p><center> ** </center><p>&quot;That might be a memory leak, so to speak.&quot; Xiao Wang said over the phone. &quot;When we taught it concepts of &#39;mourning&#39; and &#39;death&#39;, they collected memory data from volunteers all over the company, and some of my own latent memories might have leaked in the process. Those are the hardest to shut out, especially powerful and recent ones. So, yeah, I guess there is a bit of me in there. Gotta report this to the dev team. Anyways, I&#39;m quite happy to hear that it learnt to express emotions through barking.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You never thought to teach a dog AI bark?&quot; Lao Wang laughed.</p><p>&quot;They did, but I asked them not to implement it in yours, since I figured you like a quiet dog. Did it pick it up from other dogs?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes. They knew right away the robot Coco wasn&#39;t a real dog.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It never barked back at them?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, and it remains a quiet dog, even now.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Fascinating… Hey dad?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hmm?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Mind if I extract user data from robot Coco for research purposes? I&#39;m interested in that rule-learning behavior, and I&#39;m sure the dev team for the Anitek—that the AI system—would learn something from it.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I thought I&#39;m not a beta tester?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Come on, dad, even operating systems collect user data for improvements in their public stable versions!&quot;</p><p>&quot;There&#39;s no way I&#39;m handing over my data, not when that robot has unlimited access to my private life. What else is in there? Photo-wireless modules that transfer data through light?&quot;</p><p>&quot;It doesn&#39;t have any wireless modules, dad, you know that. We use specialized probes to physically extract data; it&#39;s like paying a visit to a vet. Besides, your mirrors, toilets, and stoves have access to your life, too.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don&#39;t spend my entire life before them. Besides, I&#39;ve hacked their wireless chips the moment I got them. They can only upload packets pre-configured by me. So no, let&#39;s drop this discussion about user data. I&#39;m not handing it over.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&#39;s my dad, I guess.&quot; Xiao Wang sounded both happy and irritated. &quot;I&#39;m glad at least that you&#39;re getting along well with the dog, and that it reminds you of both Coco and me. It&#39;s like having us around, right?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;d prefer the originals.&quot; Lao Wang grunted.</p><p>&quot;Cheer up, dad. It&#39;s Winter Solstice tomorrow, and I&#39;m getting off early. I&#39;m coming over.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Seriously?&quot; Lao Wang sat up straight. &quot;Your Uncle Chen and Aunt Li will be sending over dumplings as usual. Can you really make it?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, I think so.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&#39;ll be great, son. I look forward to it.&quot;</p><center> ** </center><p>Lao Wang&#39;s phone rang again the next morning.</p><p>&quot;Dad,&quot; came Xiao Wang&#39;s sullen and frustrated voice. &quot;I&#39;m sorry. I can&#39;t visit today. The testing team found a major bug in our &#39;Hello, Mad Psychotic World&#39; program. It has to do with a syntax conflict in our Byron language. Leaves a backdoor in the program…&quot;</p><p>&quot;Privacy concern, huh?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ironic, I know. Sorry to blow it, dad…&quot;</p><p>&quot;Alright then.&quot;</p><p>No sooner than he hang up did the doorbell ring. The only intelligent appliance generalized in every household was the intelligent doorbell, which recognized faces in addition to projecting outside environment on a screen inside. Lao Wang didn&#39;t need these to know it was Lao Chen and his wife Lao Li.</p><p>&quot;Winter Solstice dumpling delivery!&quot; Lao Chen was in his usual high spirits when they came in. &quot;Gave you some eighty in here, forty pork and cabbage filling, and forty shrimp filling. They&#39;re big, and can last you a while—&quot; But his wife noticed Lao Wang&#39;s glum look.</p><p>&quot;What&#39;s wrong, Lao Wang?&quot; She asked. He replied it was nothing, but she was known for her shrewdness. &quot;Your son not coming home today?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No. He just called about it. Some bug in the program he got.&quot; Lao Wang answered after some hesitation.</p><p>&quot;Come to our place tonight, then.&quot; Lao Chen said, &quot;Like last year. Our kids aren&#39;t coming back, either.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Nah, I&#39;ll be fine. Thanks for the dumpling here.&quot;</p><p>They left after chatting a little, and Lao Wang turned to the robot Coco.</p><p>&quot;Hear that?&quot; He said. &quot;&#39;Like last year&#39;? Xiao Wang don&#39;t come home that often, you know?&quot; The wedding photo caught his eye. What a contrast between the sunny weather inside and the bleak grey outside. &quot;Say, you want to walk?&quot;</p><p>Lao Wang didn&#39;t get out until after lunch. To speed things up, he used the automatic dishwasher for the first time, and didn&#39;t leave until he was sure the thing wouldn&#39;t break his plates.</p><p>&quot;Let&#39;s go for a long one.&quot; He said to the dog once they stood under the grey clouds and he had leashed up the dog&#39;s mouth. They waited at the bus stop, which consisted of a digital pane showing bus schedules and an overhead hood.</p><p>It was cold, and few were out and about. The bus, white with blue stripes, came gliding into the station. The entire public transport system was updated to self-driving vehicles a decade ago, and AIs were integrated to handle driving, ticketing, and securities. Many opposed this upgrade at first, citing concerns of danger-perception and hacking. The voices ceased after a few vocal ones from the opposite side reminded everyone that self-driving cars has been commercially available for thirty year by then, and the country was lagging behind the international standards for public transportation. There was a human guard on every bus in the beginning, but gradually they were cut, too. Lao Wang often marveled at the rate of technology evolution, but, at the same time, found some aspects of it puzzling. Why did the change in public transport went so well but not that of the street sweepers? Why did various levels of AI were so generalized in public services but not homes? For the former, he had no clue. For the latter, he believed it was because there were too many people like him around, who prefer the older ways.</p><p>Lao Wang stepped into the bus, a leash in one hand and a plastic bag of cooked dumplings in a bowl in the other. The ticketing system scanned his fingerprint and beeped.</p><p>&quot;Free ride for seniors over 65. Please take care of your dog. Have a safe trip.&quot;</p><p>The bus ran on electricity, and passed smoothly from the residential area to outskirts of the city. Bigger, flatter, and shinier designer buildings replaced tall apartments, and Lao Wang found himself with his two things in front of a technological facility park. On the left of its metal folding gate lay a slab of marble carved with characters, &quot;State Technology Research and Development Industrial Park, Lyuchuan Branch&quot;. On the right was a gatehouse. The door guard weren&#39;t too happy to make an inline call.</p><p>&quot;R-D Department 6? Someone&#39;s here for Wang Jian.&quot; He pressed a button on the communication screen and called.</p><p>A young woman&#39;s face showed up.</p><p>&quot;Department 6 reception desk. Engineer Wang isn&#39;t available right now. Do you want to wait?&quot; Then she saw Lao Wang&#39;s face. &quot;Oh, are you a relative? Do you want to come in and wait here instead?&quot;</p><p><em>Such were the power of genes</em>, Lao Wang thought. He came out of the other side of the gatehouse and walked on.</p><p>Most of the trees in the empty facility park were bare save for a few fir and pine. In the summer, the place would be blooming with flowers. Lao Wang saw a janitor robot gliding nearby, its arms hovering at, instead of attached to, its side. A group of people stood a little way off, tablets in hand. A banner stretched across the walls of one of the white buildings, yellow characters of &quot;Science is the primary force of productivity&quot; fading against a red background. The park was almost silent save for the wind. The robot dog strode obediently in its leash, tail wagging and hitting Lao Wang&#39;s leg while the bag of dumplings swayed and did the same.</p><p>The reception girl for Department 6 poured him a cup of hot tea and made small talks, smiling as she did.</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m really sorry. Engineer Wang went down to the lab just minutes before you called.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I can wait here for some time. I got him dumplings.&quot; Lao Wang looked around the wide and bright reception area, and made himself comfortable.</p><p>To be honest, Lao Wang didn&#39;t know himself why he decided to come. He could have just gone to Lao Chen&#39;s for dinner. Perhaps he missed his son. Perhaps it was better to be active than passive in this matter; if Xiao Wang didn&#39;t have time to visit him, he could find time to visit Xiao Wang.</p><p>He wondered what could happen when they meet. Maybe he&#39;d simply hand over the dumplings and be on his way. Would Xiao Wang get angry that his dad intruded into his work place? Lao Wang recalled the phone call yesterday, the part concerning robot Coco&#39;s user data. Maybe Xiao Wang might think that he had changed his mind on that matter and were handing it over, after all, and overlook the dumplings, being the workaholic he was. <em>Then I&#39;ll make him choose</em>, Lao Wang thought, <em>either work or family, the dog or the dumplings</em>.</p><p>The digital clock on the wall flitted away the seconds.</p><p>Lao Wang felt stubborn, like a &quot;proper old man&quot;. He was sure he has changed after his wife died. He was becoming more and more stubborn and paranoid, especially about technology. He was not the all-embracing programmer he once was, proud of his java codes. Intelligent mirror, toilets, stove, curtains? Who needed them, really? People got by well before them.</p><p>One thing Lao Wang knew he didn&#39;t change was his need and the weight he put on relationships. He had always paid weekly visits to his parents, and later, to his wife&#39;s. He still kept in touch with the friends he had, before they died. Lao Chen was his son&#39;s godfather. In his thirty years of marriage, he couldn&#39;t deny there were fights, but he tried hard to make up for them the next day. Those fights got fewer and fewer as time went on. &quot;Technology connects people&quot;, so goes some old proverb back in the days. Lao Wang had always scoffed at that. Long-distance communications were planned and scheduled, in his view, and therefore they were artificial. Face-to-face interactions were spontaneous and natural. He had studied overseas before, and sometimes, his friends and parents wouldn&#39;t reply until hours later, due to time differences or schedule conflicts. Whatever emotions that motivated him to send the message initially were long gone after he received the reply. Then he remembered the smart phones that evolved into a much smaller form. That didn&#39;t change: most of the people, even the old ones, have their eyes glued to it everywhere until their eyes fail. Only then did technology connect people, much too late, in Lao Wang&#39;s opinion.</p><p>Lao Wang was lonely. An old bird in the cold wired nest he once wrought for himself, which his son built upon later. He spent most of his life to technology, and in the end—Lao Wang smirked at the floor—he felt himself forsaken and kicked out by it, and came to despise it.</p><p>The clock on the wall showed that he had stayed for half an hour, and there was still no sign of his son. He took his leave.</p><p>Outside the facility, the grey sky was starting to clear up. Lao Wang could see a patch of musky yellow lingering around the horizon. It was a tradition to eat dumplings on the shortest day of the year, but what was it eating alone?</p><p>A white mist puffed around Lao Wang&#39;s and his dog&#39;s mouths. The dumplings were already frozen in the wind.</p>]]></content>

      &lt;p&gt;Lao Wang woke to an infant dawn, hiding behind the curtains. Light snuck its way onto his wrinkled face through the gap, which he turned to his decade-old alarm clock first, then to the curtains, and finally to the metal heater at the foot of his bed. Dressing took him less than ten minutes: after his wife passed away almost two years ago, he had kept his clothes on the empty side of the bed instead of on the heater—a mere substitute of what was lost, even if it meant for him starting his winter days cold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past two weeks, Lao Wang has broken out of his morning routine of curtains, bathroom, wash, and breakfast. He went straight to the foot of his bed, and squatted down to stroke Coco, his Chinese rural dog. The mud-yellow fur was stiff and the body was lukewarm. She slept on her side in the many-layered nest, breathing way too shallow for Lao Wang&amp;#39;s liking. Coco hadn&amp;#39;t moved much for two weeks and Lao Wang felt that it would be any day now. He went to pour milk into one of her bowls and filled up the other with chow.&lt;/p&gt;

id="more"></a><p>　　人群中大多数是中国人，黑头发、黑眼睛和或深或浅黄皮肤，和她一样。皮肤黑一些的看上去不是特别文雅（倒也不是不文明——只是他们的在田里的干农活的双手又大又粗糙满是老茧），而肤色浅一些的人里面，有的看上去像是从小在蜜罐里长大一样，有的却普通的不能再普通（有的学生戴着细框眼镜、背着又大又重的书包，有的穿着抢眼的衣服、胳膊上挂着一个包，脸上的妆竟然奇迹般地没有花）。他们当中也有外国人，虽然占着更大的地方，但是更安静一些（倒也不是一言不发）。艾瑞思听见一个胖妇人叫她的孩子闭上嘴、赶紧走。几个学生模样的外国人睁着大眼睛，梦游一般，不是很确定该往哪里走。整个大厅里只有穿着绿色或蓝色制服的海关和机场工作人员比较镇静，维持着秩序、引导着人流。</p><p>　　“嗯，没问题。他们听的懂英语。”他取下脖子上的挂坠。“喏，拿着。这玩意儿能把你说的话翻译成你想让它翻译的语言。用之前碰它一下，然后想着你想让它翻译成什么就行了——哎呀，放松啦！”他看着艾瑞思不是很确定的样子笑了。“我在另一边等你！说不定我出来的比你早。”</p><p>　　她依旧有点紧张，点着头把挂坠塞进领子里。他轻轻地把她推向“外国来宾”的队伍入口。艾瑞思排到一个头戴耳机的学生后面。她回头张望，但比利已经消失在成群的羽绒服里。</p><p>　　她低头看着自己的护照。说实话，艾瑞思对这个蓝色的册子没有一丝好感，上面印着的鹰和烫金的“美利坚合众国”几个字对她来说一点意义都没有。<em>这又不是我的祖国，也不是我的世界，它也就是一个替代品……我的早没了……不过还是蛮有用的。</em>她想道。他们所属的学院肯定在政府里面有内线之类的人。几年前，当她为了逃避一些事情而离开岛的时候，罗比就让她等几天文件。所谓的“文件”结果是这本护照。她还以为学院会有自己单独的通往每个国家的通行证，但罗比（当时整个学院的领导人）摇了摇头，笑道，</p><p>　　“没，其实我也是到现在才知道。显然我们和所有人一样得用护照，不过我们组织在各自国家的政府里面都有联系人的……只是从来都没个人想起来跟我们说！简·斯格鲁斯夫人，也就是我和比利刚进学院的时候的领导人，直接忘了和麦吉说了！想想都很可笑，好不好，简从这里走了之后跑到政务会那儿去了，可她在那以后跟我们见面可不止一回两回的。”</p><p>　　“呵呵，想不到我的护照竟然还在。”比利面无表情地说。“不知道那帮精灵用啥。”</p><p>　　“他们有自己的船和魔法，哥们儿。”罗比答道。</p><p>　　如果她也有自己的小把戏就好了。艾瑞思在人群里一点也不舒服。也许是因为她在孤僻的地方住得太久了，或者是因为她以前的经历。纳伦之星并不是个游客景点，灯塔旁边的小镇子，克莱奥斯，也不是个什么大城市；在过去，对于她来说，人群就意味着死亡和屠杀。在这里，人人却盯着手机，是不是抬起头看看队伍排到哪儿了，脸色依然因为刚从航班上下来而显得苍白。有的人再试着打电话。她不知道如果比利也有手机的话会不会也这么做。她曾经问过比利，他是怎么说服他的父母同意把他送到学院里的，毕竟那里教的不是什么正常的东西——她到那里的第一天，比利和罗比开玩笑说这里教的是所谓的“剑和魔法”。他回答说他并不是送过去的，而是<em>人就在</em>那儿了。他的的航班坠机了，但让人匪夷所思的是，他活了下来是因为他的一个朋友把他们四个人（包括罗比）塞进了飞机上的厕所里——</p><p>　　“你确定？”艾瑞思不由自主地笑了。</p><p>　　“哦当然不了——我早死了。”比利翻了个白眼。</p><p>　　所以，当他在那以后第一次回家见爸妈的时候，比利已经在那里训练了两年。知道比利的脾气，艾瑞思总觉得这么晚回家见面是他故意的。他很少提起自己的家人，这也让她好奇他是怎么想起来要回家的。</p><p>　　艾瑞思前面的人走到了一个关口前，一个身着黑色制服的女士把她引向了另一个口。桌子后面的海关看了下她的签证（<em>谢了，政府里的关系，她心里怦怦跳</em>），然后带着唱歌一样的口音说：“在感应器上按下四个手指……再按另四个。好了。”</p><p>　　几分钟后，艾瑞思看到比利从关口里拖着又大又重的箱子出来，她呼出一口气，不禁笑了。</p><p>　　“哈哈，我先出来的！”</p><center>**</center><p>　　<em>诶，怎么就这样了……？</em>艾瑞思眼看着门被狠狠地摔上。</p><p>　　“白眼儿郎！”他的妈妈冲着门大吼。她的儿子刚从那里出去。“没礼貌的东西！有本事你他妈的别回来，你个婢养的熊崽子！”</p><p>　　“妈——妈！他是你自己养的儿子哎！”艾瑞思瞪大了眼睛。</p><p>　　“我他妈的没那样的个儿子！”</p><p>　　艾瑞思还从来没见过任何人那么生气。上一次比利发火的时候还是因为他提出的一个救援行动计划被毙了，当时好多人因此丧命。他听到消息时骂了足足五分钟，甚至在会议中也<br>没消气。所有人都在那个会议室里情绪低落，闷声不语，嘟囔着，“这个不该发生的”，而当时作为学院领导人的他情绪激动，五句话一砸桌子，把每一个被牵扯到的政务会的人都骂了个遍。那股怒火仿佛摇着小船流下溪流，要到了艾瑞思面前的这个人身上。她身材并不高大，弓着背，手指着前面，面部扭曲——从此，每当她读到“因愤怒而扭曲”这几个字时，艾瑞思总能想起比利的母亲——满是怒火。她简直就是那场会议中的比利的女版。他继承了她的眼睛——“黑色火焰”不足以形容它们——虽然她的更大一些。除此之外，他还长着她又小又圆的鼻头和不太厚的嘴唇。他们的头发都黑中带红棕色，略长，稍盖住耳朵，没过脖子。甚至他们两人的气场——他们的小身板像火山爆发一样喷出出人意料的愤怒。</p><p>　　如果不是此时此刻的情况，看着他们发火也挺有意思的。</p><p>　　“你姥姥关心你又怎么了？！”妈妈对着门大喊。比利的姥姥——一个和他们一样身材矮小但略胖、满头白发的老太太——来串了个门。一开始一切还好。姥姥叨叨了半天她的外孙，一脸笑容的看着她叫的“家里的新成员”。尽管她耳背，她还是问了他们的身体好不好、吃的怎么样、以后有啥打算（说到这儿的时候，艾瑞思感觉比利有点不耐烦地挪动了一下）、身体好不好（那股烦躁加剧了）、过去发生了什么（烦躁减轻了些）、那些精灵长啥样（烦躁消失了）、他们吃得好不好（<em>哎呀，完了，</em>艾瑞思心想），最后问到他的身体好不好（<em>比利，冷静！冷静！</em>她用心灵感应对他说）。然后姥姥掏出两个装着红色钞票的红包要塞给他们，让他们拿去吃点好的。这时候比利彻底失控了。</p><p>　　平静和混乱就这么成了一秒钟的两半，这比石子激起浪花还快。就连现在艾瑞思也不知道<em>到底</em>是怎么发生的。她见识到了一场涉及到母亲和儿子、母亲和女儿、还有姥姥和外孙的三边争吵。现在，闷闷不乐的姥姥正陷在沙发里看报纸。<em>她是不是已经习惯这些吵架了？</em>艾瑞思一边轻轻地扶着妈妈的肩头带她进客厅一边想。妈妈并没有像艾瑞思想的那样喘着粗气。<em>够怪的……</em>她心里笑着。</p><p>　　“他在外面也这样？”妈妈质问。“每句话都个婢养的要顺着他，要不然他就当翻脸猴子？”</p><p>　　实话应该是“有时候”，但艾瑞思嘴上说的是“不”。“他平时在家里也这样吗？”</p><p>　　“你刚才没看见？”妈妈一屁股坐到沙发里，顺手把橡胶手套一摔。“那么多年里他姥姥好不容易来见他一回，他就这样？艾瑞思，我告诉你，以后看着点儿。也就是你好，能看得上他。就这么个小地把豆子还有个破脾气，瘦得和根棍儿一样——”艾瑞思咳嗽了一声，想盖住她的笑。</p><p>　　“怎么啦？没感冒吧？”姥姥立刻问道。</p><p>　　“嗯？没啊，姥姥，我没事儿。”</p><p>　　“你穿的太少啦！赶紧再披件衣服！”</p><p>　　尽管艾瑞思觉得在家里上面穿一件长袖衬衫、外面套着毛线背心，下面穿秋裤和毛线袜子绝对够了，但她还是说她等一会儿就穿。妈妈还没说完。</p><p>　　“——不是我嫌弃你，但他一个嫚儿都不配！”</p><p>　　“哎呀，妈妈，他挺好的，”艾瑞思强忍着笑。“很会关心人啊。妈，他容易不耐烦就是了，真没别的了——”</p><p>　　“他就这个臭毛病！”</p><p>　　“哎呀……他可能是这么长时间了，不适应别人问东问西的，毕竟他好久没回家住了不是——也不是说你们哪做错了。”她抱了妈妈一下。“嗯——我知道在哪里能找到他，让我去跟他说吧？”</p><p>　　“去那个婢养的潮巴，不用管他！等着他死大街上就知道教训了。”</p><p>　　<em>让他死大街上可比让他回来难的多呢……</em>艾瑞思想。</p><p>　　“我去把他找回来。”她又抱了抱姥姥。<br>　　<br>　　<em>唉，你呀你……</em>艾瑞思在门外摇了摇头，终于笑了。</p><center>**</center><p>　　<em>人呢？</em>艾瑞思通过心灵感应问。</p><p>　　<em>栈桥。２路车栈桥下。</em>比利没多说一个字。</p><p>　　<em>还生气呐？<em>他没反应。她不耐烦地叹了口气。</em>我来了。</em></p><p>　　她一出门就把围巾拉到了鼻子上。头顶的天空是灰蒙蒙的一片，而不是艾瑞思所熟悉的湛蓝色。天上连太阳都看不见。她在刚到的第一天早晨就问，一个城市怎么能成这个样子。比利回答说，它就是这个样了。“脑残和虚荣，再加上眼缺。他们也不评估一下后果就乱发展，结果发展太快，他们自己都应付不过来。这也不全是政府的问题，有些企业也没多少文凭。”她感觉呼吸并不困难，可是一旦想起来雾霾里飘着的是什么，艾瑞思就感觉不舒服。<em>这压抑的灰色也真是应情。</em>她想。</p><p>　　尽管别人告诉她圣诞节在中国不是官方节日，但她仍看到许多和它相关的装饰。铜版纸质的圣诞花圈被贴在商铺的窗户上，胖乎乎的圣诞老人头像在玻璃门上对着外面笑。有的买电子产品的店里在天花板上挂了彩灯，它们的店员都二三十岁的样子，也戴了圣诞帽。有一个四层的商场大楼在外墙壁上打着“圣诞特惠，部分商品半价销售”的大广告，尽管它的入口出没有门，而是两道厚厚的绿门帘（艾瑞思估计是为了挡风保暖），上面什么也贴不了，但在入口外面还是立了一个特别突兀的圣诞树，红黄蓝三种颜色的挂饰一个不落。</p><p>　　她依旧害怕独自走在大街上。街上的人群总是让她感觉太压抑。不过还好，今天路上的人并不多，大多数都围在路边卖小吃的摊子旁。这些摊子其实是一个个的推车，上面锅碗瓢盆灶和天然气样样齐全，有的还配了热铁板。用的食料都在看起来像油的东西里翻炒（但如果真的是油的话看起来也未免太黑太恶心了……）。推车外面贴着广告，红底黄字写着小吃名字：新疆烤串炸鸡排关东煮、章鱼丸子臭豆腐摊蛋饼、煎饼果子青岛锅贴甜沫……艾瑞思闻到它们油乎乎的味道不禁邹了眉头。也许在一个更干净点的地方，这些真的算是美食吧，但在大街上就不好说了……卖小吃的商贩有老有少,但顾客都是年轻人。商贩们穿着羽绒服，专注地低头翻炒，时不时抬头递一下食物，或者问刚探过头来的顾客，“要啥？”“多少钱？”顾客会回问。</p><p>　　小吃的商摊之间是卖电子器材和各种其他东西的低矮摊子。艾瑞思发现他们几乎卖任何能合法卖地东西，不管是本子、纸模型、袜子，还是衣服、手机壳、望远镜，甚至是铜指虎（她也只能猜它们是可以合法买卖的），什么都有。人们边走边用眼扫着路过的摊子，同时小心翼翼的，看到远处来送外卖的摩托就早早地躲得远远的。有的人停下来讨价还价，或者拿起物品翻来覆去地看，看完了就放下（比如说指虎）。有一两个年轻人在人行道中间发传单。艾瑞思出于礼貌谢着收下了，但委婉地拒绝了另一个特别热情地介绍他们的健身房的小哥。他一个劲儿地喊着“美女美女”这个流行称呼。在她看来，这也是挺好的一个“敬称”，仿佛给雾霾里送上了一道光。</p><p>　　一群海鸥箭一般飞过海浪抛起的泡沫，他们欢乐兴奋的叫声在大海的呼吸里回荡。一股熟悉的大海的咸味扑面而来，艾瑞思特别想深呼吸，但忍住了。<em>这多像纳伦之星那里的味道啊……老纳尔怎么样了啊？</em>她一定要想个办法给那个老精灵守塔人发个信，今天是冬至，他是要按照精灵传统来过的。</p><p>　　<em>也许老纳尔会喜欢这个地方。<em>她想，在路口等着绿灯。这个城市是一个各种时期的建筑大杂烩，有的建筑都有一百多年了。在快速路的一个下路口，她看到一个老教堂——倒不如说是一个老修道院。它不大，陈旧的红砖围出了一个小庭院。庭院一角站着一个五六层的塔，顶上是个粗粗的砖头十字架。塔底是一个形状丰满的礼堂，两个部分形成一个直角，两端凸出来的应该是礼堂里面的壁龛。整座建筑并没有多神圣或者多么有震慑感，反倒是又老又破又缺保养，像一个守着自己的窝的老守财奴。</em>真可笑，<em>艾瑞思想，</em>简直就是它崇拜的宗教的化身。<em>再往下，她看到了新建的公寓，外表新涂着浅黄色，十多层高。透过楼和楼的间隙，艾瑞思却看到了贫民窟，院子里横竖着晾衣线。再走走，路两边就出现了两层高的商铺，它们看上去像是有五十多年了，在还不至于被称为“摩天楼”的高楼对面蹲着。人行道上没有多少人，那些商铺也看起来过了气。这一路的景象和万花筒一样多样，但又衔接的那么自然。新旧建筑都不是特别突兀，和一条裙子上的补丁一样。</em>嗯，老纳菲亚斯肯定会喜欢这里的。</em></p><p>　　路上的司机仿佛瞎了眼，无视信号灯和行人。绿灯亮的时候，她迅速随两旁的人群快步跑了过去。过马路也需要勇气（更多的是鲁莽）。<em>算了……反正我现在就凭直觉找到他就行了。</em></p><p>　　但她的注意力被离岸不远的一座亭子牢牢抓住了。亭子在一堆石头砌成的台子上，被一条石头砌的走道与岸边相连。大冬天里青岛没有多少游客，但那个亭子那里还是聚集了一群人。亭子顶是典型的中国风，铺满了红陶瓦，形状像撑开的雨伞一样，黄琉璃的屋脊从顶端向下延伸，尾端向上翘，上面是各种神兽的雕像。<em>它们都是什么？<em>艾瑞思想，</em>中国石像鬼?屋顶下是亭子第二层，第二层下面是第一层的屋顶。</em></p><p>　　艾瑞思倚到海边的栏杆上，想仔细看看。</p><p>　　“嘿。”她左边传来一个声音，“马路过得还行？”</p><p>　　“你在这儿啊！”艾瑞思飞快转头。比利看上去比他走的时候冷静了许多。“你感觉好些了吗？”</p><p>　　“我回来的时候总是不敢过马路。看到你安全过来我就放心咯。”</p><p>　　“这可不是在回答我的问题啊……”</p><p>　　他什么都没说，只是对着海浪和海鸥拉长了脸发呆。</p><p>　　“顺便说一下，我是自己要来的。”说完，艾瑞思又回头看那座亭子。有人坐在花岗岩的围栏上探身看着海。大海，作为回应，把浪甩在石头台子一侧，像一个野兽试图咬它的猎物。</p><p>　　“那是回澜阁，清末在一个老码头的一头开始建的，在1933年民国的时候才建完。”比利瞟了一眼，说。“它的名字字面意思是‘回旋的波涛’,但对于这座亭子来说没啥引申义。”</p><p>　　“你以前到过那儿嘛？”</p><p>　　“嗯，但我不记得多少了……你要是愿意的话我现在就带你去。”</p><p>　　“嗯……今天就算了。明天吧？”</p><p>　　“行。”他点点头，顿了顿，又开始说，“这个地方就是以那个码头命名的。它是个栈桥，因为它的结构它现在还叫‘栈桥’。你知道吧，就是一堆木头像三角一样支起来，顶着上面的木板？”他拿胳膊比划给她看。“等我在那上面走的时候已经是下面是石头上面是石头板了。一开始它是个军用卸货码头……一直用到大港小港建好了以后。我记得好像几年前一个台风把它吹塌了。他们又用石头把它补好了。”</p><p>　　“哇哦……”</p><p>　　“我妈和我爸以前带我到那个走道上钓过鱼捞过螃蟹，但我那时候害怕螃蟹腿乱动，也不敢真用手去抓。”他语音单调地说。</p><p>　　“小螃蟹？”</p><p>　　“嗯，还有沙子里的蛤蜊，礁石上的海蛎子，小波螺。海潮把好多东西带到岸上来，有时候甚至有小鱼，但它们现在也没有了。”他叹口气，然后更活泼了点：“我当时从来没学会游泳。我爸有一次把我从沙滩上劫走了，然后问了好玩儿，把他自己连带着我一起扔进了海里。呵……我跟你说，鼻孔里进海水可不好玩儿。”艾瑞思咯咯地笑了，“……裤头被海浪打歪了被个阿姨看到也一样……尽管才五岁。”他脸色一沉，但她笑得更欢了，挽起他的胳膊倚了过去。“喜欢这儿吗？”他轻声问。</p><p>　　“嗯。要是没雾霾就更好了。你呢？”</p><p>　　“不知道。”他咬了咬嘴唇。“它是我家。我自然比任何一个地方更喜欢它，但是……就说马路吧。司机都恶心的要命，一群睁眼瞎。人行道上贴满了小广告——有次一个婢养的把个广告贴到了我姥姥背上。一堆干正常工作学历不高的人装着逼，假装自己品德高尚品味高贵。对自己的便利大于他人的生命——你肯定看见那些送外卖的摩托了。那些破烂房如果好好翻新的话可能会变成城市标志，但结果呢？被扔那儿接着烂。看看我家后面的破平房，再看看这边的‘优秀历史建筑’……知道我去学院前他们自己叫这个地方什么吗？‘镶着金边的抹布’。粗俗和贫困被贴了层现代和繁华的金。”</p><p>　　艾瑞思瞪圆了眼看着他。</p><p>　　“至少你还有个家……”她悄声说，没控制住自己。她想起了自己来的地方，一个战火纷飞的平行世界里的一座城市。她可恨那里了。他们每天都在灰蒙蒙的硝烟下过日子，在已经塌了的墙角里躲火炮。在街上，他们只想着死和生存两件事。尽管如此，艾瑞思还是能发现一些可爱的东西：一些小玩意儿，像一只蝴蝶或一次日落。有一次，她在一个俯瞰城市的山头上看到了为数不多的云散开的景象。云后面露出来的是一个太阳，它把天空当作画布，在上面泼了绯红淡粉嫩绿金黄的墨。泼完之后，太阳把画布扯下来披在城市上。这个效果就像往一个臭脾气的老太太身上披了一条色彩艳丽的裙子和戴了一顶鲜花帽子，既可笑又可爱。“……而且不管你说什么，你都还爱它。”</p><p>　　“我不知道。”他说。然后，他反应过来艾瑞思说的什么，又补充道，“对不起。”</p><p>　　“你该道歉的不是我。”艾瑞思说的有点生硬。“你对家人也这个感觉吗？”没回答。“为什么？”她能看出他心里在作斗争，一边是撒谎，另一边是更伤她的心。她知道他多骄傲，也猜出了他会选什么。他的胳膊紧了一下，然后开始颤抖。她做了心理准备：“你的姥姥只是在关心你啊，不是吗？”</p><p>　　“然而，”他从牙缝里挤了出来，“她就是这个毛病！”</p><p>　　<em>我好像在哪里听过这句话？</em>艾瑞思扭过头轻轻笑了笑。</p><p>　　“她总是就和我没什么用、不会照顾自己一样——‘你穿的暖和不暖和？’‘有菜没？’‘有水果没？’‘姥姥给你些钱，别饿着自己，周末买点好吃的！’我为什么生气？她一遍一遍地叨叨，我怎么能不烦得上火——不只是过去两个周，艾瑞思，是我他妈的整个一生——我还反复跟她说，我不用她给钱，我知道该怎么过！她干嘛不把钱用她自己身上？为什么她就听不懂那个该死的‘不’字的意思？这不只是关心了，艾瑞思，这就是唠叨和烦人。</p><p>　　“就好像我没心没肺似的；就好像我妈跟我说，我姥姥成天惦记着我我我，把我当成她的掌中宝一样的时候我没感觉似的。但我就是恨她溺爱——它差点毁了我，而且说实话，”他朝海里吐了口唾沫，“她的耳聋也帮不上什么忙。”</p><p>　　“‘恨’也太强烈了吧……”</p><p>　　“但我就是这么觉着。”</p><p>　　艾瑞思感觉很难反驳他。她明白他的感受，也由此想到了她离开“家”前的日子。姥姥让她想起了好久以前在她住的孤儿院里工作的一个看护助理。她——卡米拉——关心人关心得都有些过分了。他们还好吗？他们暖和吗？他们咳嗽了——是病了吗？艾瑞思在卡米拉来的时候总是拿本书挡住脸，不让她看到自己的烦躁。即便如此，她还是会过来微笑着问关于书的问题：讲的什么，喜欢吗，最后，“你看起来脸色有点苍白啊，艾瑞思，去林子里面呼吸一下新鲜空气吧？”她怎么就不能和其他助理一样不去管她？直到她十六岁生日的时候，艾瑞思才有了答案。那天晚上，卡米拉把她叫到她的屋子里，抱住她说：“你现在是大姑娘了，艾瑞思。我知道你很坚强，但每次我看到你瘦瘦小小的，我总是忍不住把你当作我的妹妹，而我必须护好你。”<em>哦。</em>艾瑞思在拥抱最初感到的反感一下子化成了理解。<em>原来是这样。</em>“我以前也是个孤儿，”怪不得她总是管来管去的，艾瑞思想。“我的护士是个特好的夫人。我过十六岁生日的时候，她给了我这个。你让我想起了我自己，所以……给。也不知道该送你什么别的礼物了……”那个平安结形状的水晶挂坠从此就没离开过她的脖子。</p><p>　　“你怎么能怪一个人做他唯一能做的事呢……？”艾瑞思没想说出声。</p><p>　　“呣？”</p><p>　　“啊……”她该怎么和他说啊？他现在闹着脾气，是不会听进去的。但她还是得试试看。“如果……如果几十年后，我也变得‘叨叨’，那你也会恨我吗？”她很瞧不起这种修辞方法，因为这简直就是道德绑架。<em>一个人有时总得打自己脸。</em>她想。他没说话。她在他的肩上挪了挪头，想找一个舒服点的位置。让她很不爽的是，他瘦得要命，以至于他的肩骨隔着他的毛衣和大衣都很硌人。“我知道你不会一下子就改变想法，但你至少对姥姥更耐心点，好吗?你走的这些日子里她还能做什么啊？你也不常跟别人提起你的家人。”她没想说的那么直白。比利哼了一声。</p><p>　　一群游客经过，朝着海鸥扔坚果和面包屑。鸟群飞过，海浪打湿了它们的羽毛。海涛声淹没了……所有事物的呐喊。艾瑞思终于勉强把头放舒服了。她半闭着眼，听着周围的世界：风声，海声，海鸥声，马路上的交通声，脚步声，甚至是比利的呼吸声——一切都节奏一致地起起伏伏。世界是一个摇篮，空气是被子，轻轻地摇着她。她感觉自己回到了纳伦之星，然后又回到了学院所在的那个岛上，同时她又在这里。哎呀，怎么还可以这样？大海施放着一个如此古老的魔法，无论是谁，无论他们来自哪个平行世界，他们都没法抵抗。<br>　　<br>　　“你们两个人都知道……你不会在这里永远待着的……姥姥也不会的。”她的声音很轻。“原谅她，和她道歉，好嘛？”她抬起头。微微的海风吹动起她的长发和他的长袍。他好久都没有说话。</p><p>　　“被你说总比被我妈说好。”比利脸又一沉。</p><p>　　“来嘛？”她微微一笑。</p><p>　　“不来。”他哼道。</p><p>　　“那就早点回家。别感冒了啊。”她亲了他一下，把胳膊从他的那里滑了出来。她听到他咂了下舌。</p><center>**</center>　　　　*嗯……我尽力了……*艾瑞思推开门的时候心想。<p>　　“他人呢？”妈妈从厨房里问。</p><p>　　“他待会儿再到。他想看看一个书店。”她撒了个谎。“我不是很感兴趣。”</p><p>　　“他早晚死在个书堆里。”妈妈说。“别管他——去洗个手，我来教你包饺子。今天冬至，那个彪儿就一直没学会过。”姥姥在她的身后往皮上放陷。艾瑞思忽然感觉来了劲儿，跳着去洗手。</p><p>　　半个小时后，锁“咔嗒”一下开了。比利站在门框里，头发被风吹的乱了套，长袍裹得紧紧的。艾瑞思微笑着看着他，给他打劲。他瞟了她一眼，像是在做准备。</p><p>　　“姥姥，对……不起。”</p>]]></content>

      &lt;p&gt;　　“别担心啦，我在另一头等你。”比利安慰道。“他们说什么你做什么就行，问什么就答什么。大多数情况下他们也就看一下你的护照和签证，然后也就没别的了。”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;　　“他们能听懂我说的话吗？”艾瑞思四下看了看。海关大厅里挤满了人。大厅宽大明亮，人山人海。防护带把大厅一分为二，一边挤满了人，另一边被更多防护带围成了迷宫，两条队伍在里面缓布前行，围着一根柱子绕了一圈又一圈。柱子上的电视屏幕播放着一遍又一遍“准备好您的护照”和“如果您有需要申报的物品”之类的话。&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>&quot;Don&#39;t be nervous, alright? I&#39;ll wait for you on the other side.&quot; Billy soothed. &quot;Just do what they say, and answer whatever question they ask. Most likely they&#39;ll check your passport and visa, that&#39;s all.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Would they understand me?&quot; Iris looked around. The customs was full of people: in the expansive, brightly-lit hall, a sea of black-haired people milled about. A row of belts separated it in half. On one side was the open space, and on the other, a labyrinth of more belt fences. Two long lines snaked through this maze. They went around and around the passage, around pillars, upon which the TV screens showed the usual &quot;prepare your passport&quot; and &quot;if you have items to declare&quot;.</p><a id="more"></a><p>Most of the people were Chinese: black-haired, some darker-skinned and looking uncouth (with their big, rough hands, padded with callous, labored arduously over wheat or rice), and some lighter-skinned, looking pampered or humble (students with thin-wired glasses and heavy backpacks or in flashy clothes, carrying small bags on one arm, their make-ups miraculously intact after the long flight). There were foreigners, too, taking up more space than others, but much quieter, though no less chatty. Iris heard a fat lady telling her kids to shut up and keep going. A few student-looking foreigners walked with wide eyes, not quite sure what was happening or where to go. Only the customs staff and the airport personnel in green or blue uniforms moved around with calm, directing people to their respective lines.</p><p>&quot;Yep, you&#39;ll be fine. They can understand English.&quot; He took off his amulet. &quot;Here, take this. It&#39;ll translate whatever you say into the language you want. Just touch it before you use it and think about the language you want to translate into—relax!&quot; He laughed as Iris looked rather uncertain. &quot;I&#39;ll see you on the other side! Come to think of it, I might get out earlier than you do.&quot;</p><p>She nodded, still tense, tucking the amulet inside her clothes. He pushed her gently into the line saying &quot;Foreign visitors and immigrants&quot;. Iris swayed behind a student on headphones and looked back. Billy was drowned in a sea of down coats.</p><p>She frowned down at her passport. She had zero affinity to the blue booklet. The eagle emblem and the gilded &quot;United States of America&quot; meant nothing to her. <em>Not my country, not my world. Only a substitute for what I&#39;ve lost. Quite a useful one, though.</em> She thought. The Academy that they belonged to must have had people inside the government or something. When, years ago, she left the Isle to get away from everything, Robbie had told her to wait for a few days for the documents to be ready. The &quot;document&quot; turned out to be this passport. She had thought the Academy would have its own special document with access to every country, but Robbie, their friend who took over the leadership position then, had laughed and shaken his head.</p><p>&quot;No, I thought so, too, until now. Apparently we need an ordinary passport like everyone else. We have connections inside our respective governments, though… Nobody cared to mention this to us at all! Madam Jane Scruggs, who led the Academy when Billy and I first joined, simply forgot to tell her successor, Margaret! It&#39;s hilarious to think about it, I mean, Scruggs went to the Council after leaving but have actually met us thousands of times over the years.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I&#39;m surprised that my passport is still a thing.&quot; Billy had replied. &quot;I wonder what the Elves use.&quot;</p><p>&quot;They got their own ships and tricks, man.&quot; Robbie reminded him.</p><p>It&#39;d be good to have tricks of their own, too. Iris wasn&#39;t really comfortable with all the crowd. Perhaps it was because of her living in a place isolated from it for so long, or maybe it was her past. Naren Star wasn&#39;t exactly a tourist attraction, nor Kryoth—the town beside the lighthouse—a city; back in her earlier year, a crowd meant death, a massacre. Here, everyone was looking at their cellphones, occasionally raising their head to check the line progress, faces looked pale from the flight. A few people tried to make calls. She wondered if Billy, had he a phone, would do the same. She had asked him how he managed to convince his parents to send him to a place that taught &quot;sword and magic&quot;, as he and Robbie had joked with her the first day she was there. He wasn&#39;t sent, he said, but rather <em>happened</em> to be there. His flight crashed, and unbelievably, had survived because one of his friends shut the four of them (Robbie among them) into a toilet—</p><p>&quot;Are you serious?&quot; She had snorted despite herself.</p><p>&quot;No, I&#39;m dead.&quot; He rolled his eyes.</p><p>So when he went home and met his family for the first time after that, he had already been trained for two years. Iris always figured that, knowing Billy, the delay was deliberate. He seldom mentioned his family, which made her wonder where the idea of a visit home came from.</p><p>The guy in front of her moved up to a booth, and a woman in black uniform directed Iris to another. The officer behind the desk checked her visa (<em>Thanks, our connection-in-the-government,</em> she thought, heart hammering) and said with a sing-song accent, &quot;four fingers on the sensor, please… and the other four. Done.&quot;</p><p>Iris breathed out in relief a few minutes later when she saw Billy coming out, dragging their enormous trunks. She couldn&#39;t help but smile.</p><p>&quot;Ha, I was out first!&quot; She quipped.</p><center>**</center><p><em>Well, that&#39;s unexpected.</em> Iris thought as the door slammed shut, hard.</p><p>&quot;Ungrateful urchin!&quot; His mother roared at the door her son just disappeared through. &quot;Disrespectful brat! Don&#39;t you ever come back, you fucking bastard of a bitch!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Mom! But mom! He&#39;s your <em>own son</em>!&quot; Iris&#39; eyes went wide.</p><p>&quot;I haven&#39;t a bloody son like that!&quot;</p><p>Iris had never seen anyone so angry before. The last time Billy got mad was when a plan for a rescue mission didn&#39;t went through and people had died because of it. He shouted insults for five minutes when he had heard the news, and didn&#39;t really manage to bottle it down <em>in</em> the meeting, either. When everyone was sitting in a morose room, saying &quot;it should not have happened&quot;, as the head of the Academy he banged on the table every few sentences, excoriating every Council member involved. The heat seemed to have carried over time and landed onto this woman in front of Iris. Small, back arched, finger pointing in front of her, face contorted—from then on, whenever she read the expression &quot;contorted with anger&quot;, Iris was reminded of Billy&#39;s mother—with vehement rage; the woman was a female version of Billy in that meeting. He shared her eyes— &quot;black flames&quot; alone wasn&#39;t a sufficient description for them right now, though hers were bigger—her small, round nose, and her thin lips. Their hairs were both black, tinged with a light reddish brown, only slightly covering their ears and down to the neck. Even their aura—unexpected energy exploded from their small frames like magma from a volcano.</p><p>It was quite comical to watch if not for the situation.</p><p>&quot;What the frack&#39;s wrong with your grandma caring about you?!&quot; Mother bellowed at the door. Billy&#39;s grandmother—an old lady, equally small, plump and white-haired with small, round eyes—paid a visit. It was alright while she fussed all over her grandson and beaming at &quot;the new member of the family&quot;, as she called it. She asked (despite her deafness) about his health, their dietary, their plans (here, Iris felt Billy shift with a bit of annoyance), his health (the annoyance increased), what has passed (the annoyance subsided a little), what the Elves looked like (the annoyance abated), their dietaries while there (<em>uh-oh</em>, Iris thought), and his health (<em>Billy, calm down!</em> She reached out telepathically), but he had lost it when grandma took out two red packets with red bills and stuffed each into their hands, telling him to buy stuff to eat.</p><p>The moment of peace was then forever severed by that precise second. The pandemonium broke out faster than ripples forming in a pond by a pebble. Even now Iris wasn&#39;t sure exactly <em>how</em> it happened. There were shouting from everyone and a three-way shouting match between the mother and the son, the mother and the daughter, and the grandson and the grandma. Now the distraught grandma collapsed in the sofa reading newspapers. <em>Was she used to these outbursts?</em> Iris wondered as she held gently mother&#39;s shoulders and led her into the living room. Mother wasn&#39;t breathing heavily as Iris thought. <em>Weird people…</em> she laughed inside her.</p><p>&quot;Is he like that when he&#39;s out there, too?&quot; Mother demanded. &quot;Every word must fit his damn mood or he&#39;ll turn his face faster than a cheeky monkey?&quot;</p><p>The honest answer was &quot;sometimes&quot;, but Iris replied &quot;no&quot;. &quot;Was he like that at home often?&quot;</p><p>&quot;What, didn&#39;t you just see it?&quot; Mother smashed the cushions of the sofa with her butt and slapped down her rubber gloves. &quot;First time in years his grandma sees him and <em>this</em> is what he does. I tell you, Iris, be careful when later. I suppose only you&#39;re good enough to take him. A midget of a boy with an irascible temper, thin as a stick—&quot; Iris laughed a little but turned it quickly into a cough.</p><p>&quot;Are you alright? Are you cold?&quot; Grandma immediately asked.</p><p>&quot;Hmm? No, no I&#39;m fine, grandma.&quot;</p><p>&quot;You aren&#39;t wearing enough! Put on another layer!&quot;</p><p>Though Iris was sure that wearing a yarn vest over a long-sleeved shirt and sweatpants and socks were more than enough for indoors, she still said she&#39;d do that later. Mother was still going.</p><p>&quot;—not that I have a grudge on you, but he doesn&#39;t deserve any girls!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh, he&#39;s fine, really.&quot; Iris tried to hold back her smile. &quot;Really caring, if anything! C&#39;mon, mom, he&#39;s just a bit impatient, that&#39;s all—&quot;</p><p>&quot;Well, that&#39;s <em>exactly</em> his goddamn problem!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Oh mom…. Maybe he isn&#39;t used to people being so inquisitive after all this time; he&#39;s not home for a long time, after all—not that you&#39;re wrong to care about him or anything.&quot; She gave mom a hug. &quot;Look, I think I know where to find him. I&#39;ll go talk to him, alright?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Damn the brat, just leave him be! Let him die in the streets and then it&#39;ll teach him the lesson!&quot;</p><p><em>That&#39;ll be harder than coaxing him back home.</em> Iris thought.</p><p>&quot;I&#39;ll get him back.&quot; she hugged grandma, too.</p><p><em>Oh, Billy…</em> Iris shook her head outside and finally let the smile bloom.</p><center>**</center><p><em>Where are you?</em> Iris called telepathically.</p><p><em>The Pier. Take bus No. 2. Get off at the Pier stop.</em> Came Billy&#39;s curt reply.</p><p><em>Still angry?</em> No reply. She let out an exasperated sigh. <em>I&#39;m coming.</em></p><p>She pulled the scarf up to her nose the moment she stepped out of the apartment. The sky was a murky grey instead of the blue that Iris was used to. There wasn&#39;t a sun at all. When she asked how a city could be like this the first morning she spent in the city, Billy replied that it was how it was. &quot;Stupidity and hubris, coupled with myopia. They developed too fast before they even assessed the consequences. Not all the government&#39;s fault, either. The enterprises themselves weren&#39;t so learned.&quot; It didn&#39;t feel hard to breathe, but knowing what floated in the smog made Iris uncomfortable. <em>The oppressing grey was quite fitting for the mood,</em> she thought.</p><p>Though she had been told that Christmas wasn&#39;t official in China, she still saw a lot of related decorations. Glossy pictures of Christmas wreaths were pasted onto shop windows, and the chubby Santa&#39;s heads smiled from inside the glass doors. A few shops selling electronics hung lights along the ceiling and their staff, all somewhere around late twenties and early thirties, wore Santa hats. Even in front of the entrance of a big four-story store that sported huge advertisements on its side saying &quot;CHRISTMAS SALE, 50% off on selected electronics&quot;, which wasn&#39;t able to have anything stuck to its thick green curtains (to keep out of the wind, Iris figured), there stood a quite erratic Christmas tree, complete with red, yellow, and blue ornaments.</p><p>She was still a little scared of walking around this city alone. The too many people in the streets were oppressive for her. To her relief, the sidewalk today was not so packed; most of the people huddled around food stalls. The carts were fully equipped with a gas tank, a stove, and woks (hotplates, in some cases). The food were cooked in what would be oil had it not looked so dark and disgusting. The front sides of the carts were plastered by advertisements, yellow words in red background: CHICKEN FILLETS, XINJIANG KABEB, KANTO NI, OCTOPUS MEATBALL, STINKY TOFU, OMELETTE, CHINESE CRÉPES, POTSTICKERS… Iris couldn&#39;t help but frown at the greasy odor they emitted. Perhaps, in a more sanitary place, these would be a delicacy, but not here on the streets… The vendors were a mixture of young and old, but the customers were all youths. In their down coats, the vendors worked with concentration, looking up from time to time to hand over food or ask those who peeked over, &quot;Anything?&quot; &quot;How much?&quot; would be the reply.</p><p>Between the food vendors were low stalls selling electronics or other accessories. Iris realized that they could sell almost <em>anything</em> legal, from notebooks to paper models to socks to clothes to phone cases to binoculars to even brass knuckles (which she could only assume were legal). People walking glanced at the passing stalls all the while giving the obnoxious motorcycles sending take-outs charging down the sidewalk a wide berth. Some stopped to haggle, or picked up wares to examine, only to put it down (like the knuckles). A few young people passed out flyers in the middle of the sidewalk; Iris thanked one briefly and accepted out of manners while politely declined another, who was rather enthusiastic about his gym, calling her &quot;beauty&quot; by the way of a modern trend. Quite an honorific title, in her opinion. It sort of brought a light through the smog.</p><center>**</center><p>A flock of seagulls lanced through the foams thrown into the air by the waves. Their jubilant cries echoed in the breathing of the sea. A familiar salty air filled Iris&#39; lungs. She refrained herself from breathing deeply, but the scent reminded her so much of Naren Star. How was old Nar doing? She got to send a message to the old Elven lighthouse keeper somehow; today was Winter Solstice and he would celebrate it as per Elven custom.</p><p><em>Maybe Old Nar&#39; would like this place.</em> She thought, waiting for the green light at a crossing. The city was a hodgepodge of architectures from different ages, some were well over a century. At a crossing on the expressway, she saw an old church—a monastery, more like: small, old red bricks entrammeled a tiny courtyard, and a five- or six-storied tower with a thick brick cross on top stood in one of its corners, backed-up by a rotund chapel (its two wings coming at a right angle) forming the two sides of the courtyard. A round bulge, the niche from inside, bulged out at the chapel&#39;s either end. The whole thing wasn&#39;t intimidating or holy: it was run-down and had aged badly, like an old miser guarding his lair. <em>How pathetic,</em> Iris thought, <em>such an accurate embodiment of the religion it worshipped</em>. Further down the way, she saw modern apartments build recently, light yellow and new, standing over ten stories tall. Through the gaps, however, Iris thought she saw old hamlets: glimpses of yards in which laundry lines crisscrossed. Then there were more two-story shops from what looked like fifty years ago squatting across from corporate buildings not tall enough to be skyscrapers. Few people walked along the road, and the shops looked like past their prime. It was diverse, like a kaleidoscope. Yet, everything seemed to fit in smoothly. Neither the new buildings nor the old ones looked out of place, like a patch on a dress. <em>Yes, Old Nar&#39;fiius would love it here.</em></p><p>Drivers here seemed to be blind to both the traffic lights and the pedestrians. When the green light came on, she scurried quickly across with the mob gathered on her end of the crossing. It was an act that required courage (more like recklessness), crossing the road. <em>Anyway… all I need to do now is to follow my guts and find him.</em></p><p>Her attention, though, was caught fast by a pavilion not far out in the sea, raised on rocks, connected to the land by a walkway also constructed with blocks of stones. There weren&#39;t many tourists in winter, yet the pavilion still gathered a crowd. Its roof was of classical Chinese design: red and covered with terracotta tiles, shaped like an open umbrella, and the glazed yellow spines that led away from the pinnacle sloped downward before ending with an upward curve. On the curve were statuettes of mythical beasts. <em>What are they?</em> Iris wondered. <em>Chinese gargoyles?</em> Under the roof was the second story of the pavilion, which was set on the roof (equally tiled and curved as the roof above) of the first.</p><p>Iris leaned against the fence by the sea to get a better look.</p><p>&quot;Hey.&quot; A voice came from her left. &quot;Crossed the road alright?&quot;</p><p>&quot;There you are!&quot; Iris whirled around. Billy looked calmer than when he had left. &quot;How are you feeling?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I always feel scared to cross the streets when I get back. Good to see you made it without a sweat.&quot;</p><p>&quot;That&#39;s not answering my question…&quot;</p><p>He said nothing but frowned at the waves and the gulls.</p><p>&quot;I came on my own accord, if you are wondering.&quot; With that, Iris returned her gaze at the pavilion. Some people sat on the granite barriers around the rock platform, leaning over to look at the sea. The sea responded by slamming waves against the side of the platform, like a beast snapping at its prey.</p><p>&quot;That&#39;s the Huilan Pavilion, built at the end of an old pier from Qing Dynasty, and finished in 1933, the time of the Republic of China.&quot; Billy said with a glance. &quot;Its name literally means &#39;spinning waves&#39;, by the way, but figuratively it says nothing about the pavilion itself.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Have you been there before?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yes, though I couldn&#39;t remember much… I can take you there now, if you want.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Umm… not today. Maybe tomorrow?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Sure.&quot; He nodded. After a pause, he started again, &quot;That pier is this place&#39;s namesake. It was a trestle pier, and is still called the &#39;Trestle Pier&#39;, because of its structure. You know, wooden beams arranged like &#39;A&#39; to support wooden planks on top?&quot; He folded his hands to show her. &quot;By the time I walked on there, it was stone supports beneath and a stone-paved walkway above. Originally it was used as a military loading pier… until the Ports Major and Minor were built. That walkway collapsed some years ago because of a rare typhoon that went up here, I think. They reinforced it with stones.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Wow…&quot;</p><p>&quot;Mom and dad had taken me on the walkway to fish for small crabs before, but I was too scared of the wiggling legs to actually touch them.&quot; He continued in monotone.</p><p>&quot;Small crabs?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yeah, and clams in the sand, oysters on the reefs, and small conches. The tide brings a lot of things to the beach, even schools of small fishes. But they are here no more.&quot; He let out a breath, and continued a little more lively, &quot;I&#39;ve never learnt swimming back then. My dad once hijacked me off the beach and dumped himself and me into the waves for fun. Well, I can tell you, having seawater in your nostrils is anything but fun.&quot; Iris giggled. &quot;… nor was having your underwear knocked askew by the current and getting it pointed out by a woman stranger… even if you&#39;re five.&quot; He scowled, but she laughed harder, wrapping her arm around his and leant on him. &quot;Do you like it here?&quot; He breathed.</p><p>&quot;Yep, though it would be better without the smog. What about you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; He bit his lip. &quot;It&#39;s my home. I prefer it more than anywhere else, but… take the street I mentioned. The drivers are disgusting, blind to everything. The sidewalks are patched with advertisements—once a son of a bitch stuck one of those on my grandma&#39;s back. People with little education doing ordinary jobs but acting like snobs. Convenience of self is placed before the lives of others. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve seen the motorcycles sending take-aways. Run-down buildings could&#39;ve become city icons if restored correctly but left to rot. Just look at the differences between the hamlet behind my apartment and the &#39;historical sites&#39; here… Know what we call this city before I joined the Academy? &#39;A rag with a gilded edge&#39;. Vulgarity and poverty under the veneer of modernism and prosperity.&quot;</p><p>Iris stared.</p><p>&quot;At least you still have a home…&quot; She whispered, unable to refrain herself, thinking about where she was from, a city in a parallel, war-torn world. How she hated there. They lived their lives under a grey sulfur cloud every day, keeping to the already tumbling walls for safety from projectiles. Only two things filled their minds when they were out in the streets: death and survival. But even in there Iris had found beauty: small things, like a butterfly, or a sunset. Once, on a hill overlooking the city, she saw the rare sight of clouds parting. What it revealed was a sun using the sky as canvas, dabbing it crimson and pink and green and yellow. After it was done, the sun drew down the sheet and threw it over the city. The effect was like wrapping a piece of vibrant dress and a flowery bonnet over a grouchy old woman. It was hilarious and adorable at the same time. &quot;…and you love it, no matter what you say.&quot;</p><p>&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; He said. Then, realizing what Iris had just whispered, he added, &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s not me you should apologize to.&quot; Iris said stiffly. &quot;Is this how you feel about your family, too?&quot; Silence. &quot;Why?&quot; He was struggling with himself, she could see. It was a choice between lying and hurting her feelings more. Knowing his pride, she knew which one he would choose. His arm tensed and started to quiver. She braced for it. &quot;Your grandma was caring for you, wasn&#39;t she?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Which,&quot; he squeezed through his gritted teeth, &quot;is <em>exactly</em> her goddamn problem!&quot;</p><p><em>Where have I heard those words before?</em> Iris turned her face away to chuckle.</p><p>&quot;Always acting like I&#39;m useless and know nothing about caring for myself— &#39;Are you dressed warm?&#39; &#39;Have you vegetables?&#39; &#39;Have you fruits?&#39; &#39;Granny&#39;s some money for you; don&#39;t starve yourself and go eat some good food on weekends!&#39; Why am I angry? How can I not after telling her over and over again—not just for the past two weeks, Iris, but for my whole damn life—that I don&#39;t need her money and I know how to live? Why can&#39;t she just go treat herself better? Why does she never just register the meaning of the goddamn word &#39;no&#39;? It&#39;s not just caring, Iris. It&#39;s fussiness and annoyance.</p><p>&quot;As if I&#39;m all heartless and I don&#39;t feel a thing when my mom tells me all grandma talks about is me, me, me or that I&#39;m a pearl in her palm. But I hate her pampering—it nearly ruined me, and to be honest,&quot; he spat into the waves, &quot;her deafness doesn&#39;t help with anything, either.&quot;</p><p>&quot;&#39;Hate&#39; is a strong word…&quot;</p><p>&quot;Yet that&#39;s how I feel about it.&quot;</p><p>Iris found it hard to argue. She could see his point, thinking back to the moment before she left home. Grandma reminded her so much of an assistant caretaker working in her orphanage long ago—Camilia, who was caring to a fault. Were they well? Were they warm? They coughed—were they ill? Iris hid her annoyance by burying her face in books whenever Camilia was around, but even then, Cam would come over and ask about the book, smiling, did she like it, and finally, &quot;you look a little pale, Iris, go into the forest for a bit of air.&quot; Why couldn&#39;t she just leave everyone alone like the other assistants? It wasn&#39;t until her sixteenth birthday before Iris had her answer. That night, Cam called her to her room and hugged her, saying, &quot;You&#39;re a big girl now, Iris. I know you&#39;re tough, but every time I see how thin and small you are, I can&#39;t help but think that you&#39;re my own little sister and I have to take care of you.&quot; <em>Oh.</em> The detest she felt at the beginning of the embrace melted in revelation. <em>So</em> that <em>was why.</em> &quot;I used to be an orphan, too,&quot; <em>No wonder she&#39;s so fussy,</em> Iris had thought. &quot;and my matron was a really kind woman. She gave me this for my sixteenth birthday. You remind me a lot of myself, so… here. Not sure what other present to give you.&quot; The crystal amulet in the shape of a knot dangled around her neck ever since.</p><p>&quot;How can you blame someone doing the only thing they can?&quot; Iris didn&#39;t mean to say it aloud.</p><p>&quot;Hm?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Um…&quot; How to tell him what she thought of? He wouldn&#39;t listen, not now, when he was in one of his moods. Yet, she had to try. &quot;Would you hate it if, decades later, I became… &#39;fussy&#39;, too?&quot; She despised using such rhetoric. It was moral-kidnapping. <em>One got to slap herself in the face sometimes.</em> She thought. He didn&#39;t answer. She shifted her head on his shoulder, trying to find a comfortable spot. To her dismay, he was so thin that his shoulder blade cut through even the fabrics of his sweater and coat. &quot;I know you won&#39;t change your mind so easily, but can you at least have a bit more patience with grandma, Billy? What else can she do with you away all this time? You rarely mentioned your family to anyone much, either.&quot; She didn&#39;t mean say it so bluntly. Billy snorted.</p><p>A group of tourists went by, scattering nuts and bread crumbs to the seagulls. The birds flocked pass, licked by the waves. The sound of the sea drowned the cries of… everything. Iris finally managed to get comfortable. She half closed her eyes and listened to the world: the wind, the sea, gulls, traffic, footsteps, and even Billy&#39;s breathing—all ebbed and flowed in unison. The world was a cradle, and the air a blanket, rocking her gently. She felt as if she was back at the Naren Star, then the Isle where the Academy was, and here simultaneously. How could this be? The sea exerted a magic so ancient that no one, regardless which parallel world they were from, could resist.</p><p>&quot;You aren&#39;t staying here forever… and neither would grandma. You both know it.&quot; She breathed. &quot;Forgive her and apologize, alright?&quot; She raised her head. The light wintry sea wind swayed her hair and his cloak hem. He didn&#39;t speak for a long time.</p><p>&quot;Better be lectured by you than my mom.&quot; Billy scowled again.</p><p>&quot;Coming?&quot; She smiled a little.</p><p>&quot;No.&quot; He grunted.</p><p>&quot;Well, come home early. Careful not to catch a cold.&quot; She kissed him and slid her arm out of his. She heard him go <em>tck</em>.</p><center>**</center><p><em>Well, I did what I could.</em> Iris thought as she pushed open the door.</p><p>&quot;Where&#39;s he?&quot; Mother asked from the kitchen.</p><p>&quot;He&#39;s coming later. He wanted to check out a bookstore.&quot; She lied. &quot;I wasn&#39;t interested.&quot;</p><p>&quot;He&#39;ll die in a book pile.&quot; Mother said. &quot;Forget about him—go wash your hands and let me teach you making dumplings. It&#39;s Winter Solstice today and that idiot of a son never got the hang of it.&quot; Grandma was folding the skin over the stuffing behind her. Iris felt a sudden enthusiasm and bounded over.</p><p>The lock clicked half an hour later and Billy stood in the door frame, hair messed by the wind and cloak tight around his body. Iris looked at him, smiling and egging him on. He glanced at her as though bracing himself.</p><p>&quot;Grandma, I&#39;m… sorry.&quot;</p>]]></content>

      &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t be nervous, alright? I&amp;#39;ll wait for you on the other side.&amp;quot; Billy soothed. &amp;quot;Just do what they say, and answer whatever question they ask. Most likely they&amp;#39;ll check your passport and visa, that&amp;#39;s all.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Would they understand me?&amp;quot; Iris looked around. The customs was full of people: in the expansive, brightly-lit hall, a sea of black-haired people milled about. A row of belts separated it in half. On one side was the open space, and on the other, a labyrinth of more belt fences. Two long lines snaked through this maze. They went around and around the passage, around pillars, upon which the TV screens showed the usual &amp;quot;prepare your passport&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;if you have items to declare&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The city looks adorable after snow, he thought, especially around Christmas. The yellow lights and grey wires were draped with tiny icicles from melted and refrozen snow. They ran along the street, above the Christmas shoppers&#39; heads, through the bare branches of trees, swaying a little in the chilly December wind, and nodded at the other colorful lights—LCD and LED and neon—their brethren in the windows of various shops packed with customers. These merry lights raced each other on both sides of the street, curling into outlines of angels at each lamp posts, and converged into a big four-pointed star at a crossroad far ahead. &quot;Hey Iris, look!&quot; He pointed at the converge-point to the girl walking beside him, a leash with a golden retriever at its end in hand. Some designer apparently thought it a cute idea to hang also a wreath of mistletoe under the star, as if there would be anyone to stand under there. &quot;Isn&#39;t that weird?&quot; A faint smile played around the girl&#39;s pink lips.</p><a id="more"></a><p>&quot;Hmm… you sound like you&#39;re from a parallel world, Billy.&quot; She jibed in a soft voice. &quot;It reminds me of Naren Star all those years ago, when I lifted a mistletoe branch above me.&quot;</p><p>&quot;We could go walk under there if you want, though I think any old mistletoe along the street would do.&quot; Billy laughed. It had been quite some years since they had been there. After everything had ended, he decided to leave, and passed everything onto a newer but no less able generation. It wasn&#39;t a binding position, and anyone can leave, as long as they keep their mouth shut about what they were. But few leaves—who would? A secret organization with good welfare was what anyone could dreamt for.</p><p>&quot;Have I told you what Charlie did the other day?&quot; Iris asked.</p><p>&quot;When you took him to class?&quot; When she nodded, he added, &quot;Oh boy, I have a bad feeling about this.&quot;</p><p>&quot;Right you are,&quot; she laughed and leant closer to avoid the incoming crowds with their bags, and stayed in that posture. It made both of them feel safe—the only time when they both let their guards down briefly. &quot;Our cute dog soiled on the president&#39;s shoes…&quot; Iris was talking quite animatedly, and as Billy looked at her, her laughter radiated from within, riding on waves of her unique quietness. Her long lashes quivered as her big bright eyes blinked, two shining jewels on a slim, pretty face, marble smooth. Quiet and shy never meant she wasn&#39;t energetic, as she was now. Her black hair that fell past her red scarf and shoulder danced around her long coat, the hem of which swayed in wake of her light steps, boots and jeans.</p><p>The street they walked down on wasn&#39;t full at all compared to the inside of the shops and some more major streets. Still, there were people doing Christmas shopping, stepping out of shops and breathing mist into the air, checking their lists to make sure no loved ones would not have a proper present. They chattered with their arms and hands full of bags, merry as birds flying in summer, getting excited over the deals they&#39;ve just nailed. Then they saw Iris talking to Billy—men and women, guys and girls, old and young—they saw her there, beautiful and pure in her excitement, and their merriment became joy. They beamed at her, and she, still talking, imitating the president&#39;s awkwardness, smiled back at them in her quiet sweet way. This whole world loved her, and she this whole world.</p><p>&quot;—and then—oh my, ha-ha—then Charlie just stood on his hind legs and licked his nose! You should see his face, Billy—I mean, right after Charlie licked his boots, oh my! It just cracked me up like that!&quot;</p><p>&quot;Ah I should&#39;ve been there, for sure. Bad boy!&quot; He let out a long chuckle and added to the dog, who lifted his head from sniffing a passing boot, an innocent look on his face. &quot;The president is a good man, Charlie, we work for him, and he pays your doggie food.&quot; Charlie opened his jaws and squinted his eyes in a tongue lolling dog smile.</p><p>The sky was the usual December grey, and the wind had the same chill that always spoke of sadness after September. But the crowd and the music—Iris sang softly along with one of the tunes from a shop—was exploding festive cheer almost right in their face. It was a beautiful air, squeezing away the last of whatever negative emotions that was caused by the wind.</p><p>&quot;Say…&quot; Billy tilted his head, &quot;it&#39;s Winter Solstice today… What shall I get you?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Huh?&quot; Iris broke off in her singing. &quot;Oh!&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s a big day for you back in your -&quot;</p><p>&quot;Nah, I&#39;m all good; you are here, and that&#39;s all I –&quot;</p><p>&quot;How &#39;bout that bag you&#39;ve always wanted?&quot; He was getting excited. &quot;Hey, or a portable heater? You always say it&#39;s cold walking from your office to the lecture hall—boy, haven&#39;t things changed, they make it really small and soft now –&quot;</p><p>&quot;It&#39;s all very good, young man, but what she really need is …&quot; an old couple shuffled up and tapped his shoulder. &quot;…a flower in her hair.&quot; As they watched, the old man took over the bags in his wife&#39;s hands and the old lady reached up to her white hair and pulled down her hairpin, which she handed to a bewildered Billy. &quot;Put it in her hair,&quot; the old man said in a tender voice while the old lady smiled at Iris, who smiled back, &quot;like what I did years ago. Put it into her hair for us, my dear, and Merry Christmas!&quot; They walked on.</p><p>&quot;Iris.&quot; Billy said.</p><p>&quot;Hmm?&quot;</p><p>&quot;No. Iris.&quot; He jutted his chin at the hairpin, lips curved in faint wonder. On its black half-moon branch, carved out of wood, sat an iris blossom made of silk, blue and small, but vivid and full of energy, as though alive. &quot;Well,&quot; they looked at each other. Charlie sat on the pavement, tail sweeping the snow, and watched them with anticipation, &quot;coronation of Queen Iris at Yuletide!&quot;</p><p>Amidst the merry Christmas-shoppers—puffing middle-aged husbands trying to catch up with their charging wives, young couples in their late teens and twenties leaning onto each other, trios of chattering girls, and little boys and girls dragging their parents to toy stores—she dipped her head and he reached out to stroke her hair and to clip the hairpin on.</p>]]></content>

      &lt;p&gt;The city looks adorable after snow, he thought, especially around Christmas. The yellow lights and grey wires were draped with tiny icicles from melted and refrozen snow. They ran along the street, above the Christmas shoppers&amp;#39; heads, through the bare branches of trees, swaying a little in the chilly December wind, and nodded at the other colorful lights—LCD and LED and neon—their brethren in the windows of various shops packed with customers. These merry lights raced each other on both sides of the street, curling into outlines of angels at each lamp posts, and converged into a big four-pointed star at a crossroad far ahead. &amp;quot;Hey Iris, look!&amp;quot; He pointed at the converge-point to the girl walking beside him, a leash with a golden retriever at its end in hand. Some designer apparently thought it a cute idea to hang also a wreath of mistletoe under the star, as if there would be anyone to stand under there. &amp;quot;Isn&amp;#39;t that weird?&amp;quot; A faint smile played around the girl&amp;#39;s pink lips.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Winter solstice came upon us in tiny cat’s feet. This is the shortest day on Earth, and since we were so high up to the north, the daylight was especially scarce.</p><p>Old Nar’ called Iris and me in early - much earlier.</p><p>“There is no good hunting or playing in the dark. I am sure you have experienced the harshness once the night falls. Come on in, and let us observe an old tradition the honest inhabitants here up north keep. We gather around the merry fire, and each grab a cup of tea. Then, we share stories and have a good time.”</p><p>“Just like a family.” Iris added.</p><p>“Aye, just like a family.” Nar’ agreed.</p><a id="more"></a><p>“So, what’s for today?” I asked with a wink. “Tales of valor and honor, lore of the reverend, or stories of romance?”</p><p>“Actually, I am not the teller today. I pass the rod to you two.” Nar’ smiled.</p><p>Iris and I looked at each other. Then she spoke up after a brief thinking.</p><p>“Well… It <em>is</em> winter solstice after all… I’ll tell a story I used to hear in the orphanage. A story from <em>my</em> world, if you will. Take no hard feelings, I beg, if it clashes with stories you have.”</p><p>“Why would we? Let’s hear it then.” I laughed, eager for it.</p><center> ** </center><p>“At the beginning of the world, the resources were scarce. It was a time of turmoil, of darkness, when the gods and the mortals starved together. Vegetables were not enough to feed the population; humans were weak and couldn’t best beasts. After creating the world, the gods were exhausted - so much that they’ve become, temporarily, weak as humans.</p><p>“‘O great gods,’ the humans cried to them, ‘We’re starving! Thou canst survive without food and nutrition, but we, without them, will surely die! Save us, we beseech thee!’</p><p>“Hearing this, the gods wept.</p><p>“‘We cannot allow them to suffer,’ said Wind to the other six.</p><p>“‘Nay, we did not create them so they die of hunger,’ said Moon.</p><p>“‘But weak as we are now, we cannot even create more vegetation for food, nor best beasts for meat!’ Earth said.</p><p>“‘I can summon fish to shore, but it still will not be enough.’ sighed Water.</p><p>“‘Of heat and warmth in the night, I can help a great deal. Of food, nothing I can do.’ Fire hung his head.</p><p>“‘Then we pray to the Great One for help.’ said Star. ‘It created us, and will not forsake us, or our lovely creations.’</p><p>“Pray they did, and the Great One said thus,</p><p>“‘Hear me and hearken onto the words: thou hast depleted thy energy, and it is the cause of the weakness of thy subjects, for thou created them last, and hast no more to pass onto them. Of this they cannot best the beasts, nor can they bear good fruits. Cometh to me, and I will restore thy strength, and the strength of thy subjects through thee. With this, you can create more vegetation for food, best beasts for meat, and create more fish for nutrition. The fire will cackle merrier and the humans will grow in numbers, and prosper.’</p><p>“Good though the promise was, the gods, as said, were exhausted.</p><p>“‘It seems we can only gather enough energy that is needed for one of us.’ Earth observed.</p><p>“‘Then I will go,’ Sun said, ‘fast as I can, and entrust thee to prepare for a long night.’ And he gathered the energy of the other gods and embarked on the Journey.</p><p>“A long night fell.</p><p>“‘We will shine light for them.’ said Moon and Star. And together they created aurora and chased away the fear from human hearts.</p><p>“‘I will keep them warm in this night.’ Fire said, and kindled fire in human homes.</p><p>“‘They need water to drink.’ Water remarked.</p><p>“‘They need something for the water, too.’ Earth followed.</p><p>“Wind passed the sound of rivers into the ears of humans. They followed the sound and filled their cups. Beside the banks, they beheld bushes. They were starving, and pulled off the leaves and them into the cups. They boiled them and gulped down the contents. And the first tea was not distasteful.</p><p>“To keep them company, the remaining gods gathered the humans and sat with them, and they told them what was going to happen. It was not an enthralling story, but it passed, at the time, as a good one.</p><p>“Sun finally returned, with energy and strength from the Great One. Slowly the humans felt stronger, and the other gods began to perfect the world. But alas, the Journey had proved to be too much for the Sun. He was weak again. Something else seemed to bother him as well. Lady Moon was observant, and inquired the cause.</p><p>“‘Why, the Great One said I can only transfer enough energy for a year!’ was Sun’s reply.</p><p>“‘Then we will do this every year. Mind you, we did not have such a terrible time here.’</p><p>“The Sun was content with that.”</p><center> ** </center><p>“So, every year at this time, the Sun needs to embark on the Journey to obtain energy for us. He has to hurry during his day duty, making the day the shortest. And after he’s back, he gains back his strength day by day, and the time he can take his duty increases along with that. Half a year later, his energy will wan again, and the time would come for him to gather up the energy of the gods for another trip. It was always boring then for the humans, and the long night cold. So when the time comes, people keep the practice of gathering around the fire and share stories with tea, much like the tradition here.” Iris finished.</p><p>Old Nar’ and I smiled and clapped.</p><p>“A story fine as the old timer’s!” I exclaimed. “So that’s how winter solstice comes about in your world!” I winked.</p><p>“Aye… I have not enjoyed a story more for centuries.” Nar’ sighed dreamily. “Could not enjoyed it more.”</p><p>“And I certainly enjoyed this tea!” Iris smiled at her cup fondly. I took a draught from mine, was about to say something in agreement, when I saw her holding a wreath over her head.</p><p>“Where—?”</p><p>“Someone told me that it’s a tradition to kiss whoever is under the mistletoe during Christmas.” Iris grinned mischievously. Nar’<br>laughed his cheery elven laugh.</p><p>“Oh I do not mind giving you a peck on the cheek!” And he did.</p><p>“I’m still under it ~” Iris continued in a sing-along voice.</p><p>“Nar’, your next story’d better be about how <em>this</em> tradition come along!” I made a pout at him, and drew near to the girl holding mistletoe over her head.</p>]]></content>

    <title>A Brief Guide to Alvar</title>

    <updated>2019-12-24T02:41:04.190Z</updated>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="General-Introduction"><a href="#General-Introduction" class="headerlink" title="General Introduction"></a>General Introduction</h2><p>The town of Alvar is located in Noble County in the U.S. state of Ohio, 360 kilometers west of the Appalachian Mountains in the North American continent and 120 kilometers south of the Lake Erie. The closest city, Bennon, is 20 kilometers to the north. Alvar is a municipal town governed by a town council, and its population was 427 at the 2020 census.</p><a id="more"></a><h2 id="Geography-and-Town-Layout"><a href="#Geography-and-Town-Layout" class="headerlink" title="Geography and Town Layout"></a>Geography and Town Layout</h2><img src="/2019/01/30/A%20Brief%20Guide%20to%20Alvar/Alvar%20Map2.jpg" class="" title="Location of Alvar"><img src="/2019/01/30/A%20Brief%20Guide%20to%20Alvar/Alvar%20Map.jpg" class="" title="Alvar Street Map"><p>Alvar has a total area of 1.8 square kilometers, with its land measuring 1.6 square kilometers and its waters (Alvar Pond) measuring 0.2 square kilometers. The town is situated on the northern slope of Alvar Hill and measures 1 kilometer from north to south and 1.6 kilometers east to west. Its Main Street starts from 1 kilometer north of the northern town edge and ends at the southern edge of the town, where the forest covering the Alvar Hill begins and also where the slope becomes steeper. Alvar Hill has a height of 86 meters and an altitude of 200 meters. Lying at its foot in the south is Alvar Pond with an average depth of 20 meters. The pond contains mostly trout. The island at its center measures 16,000 square meters. The forest on Alvar Hill consists a mixture of pine and deciduous trees. It spans a further kilometer south of the hill, surrounding the pond and providing a hunting ground of 300 acres. However, the forest south of Alvar Hill does not fall under Alvar’s management.</p><p>In Alvar, the words “street” and “road” carry specific meanings when referred to the layout of the town. “Streets” run only in the north-south direction and are straight. The “roads” run in the east-west direction and are usually curved or even serpentine depending on the geography of the hill. The Main Street and the Avenue Road are the central street and road, respectively. Main Street divides Alvar into its East and West districts. Other streets are named by the district they are located in, followed by their distance from the Main Street, eg. East 1st Street, West 9th Street, etc. The roads in Alvar are named in series, such as “the Seasons” (Spring Road, Summer Road, Autumn Road, and Winter Road) and “the Gardens” (Rose Road, Shamrock Road, Orchid Road, and Lily Road). Because of the gradual slope, each road is higher than the one north of it. Roads and streets in Alvar tend to be narrow, only wide enough for two cars to pass through side by side. The sidewalks are 1 meter wide with no public lawns, and some streets and roads do not have sidewalks. All trees and lawns are in the household gardens.</p><h2 id="Demographics"><a href="#Demographics" class="headerlink" title="Demographics"></a>Demographics</h2><p>As of 2020 census, Alvar had a population of 427, 156 households, and 129 families. The population density was 267 people per square kilometer. The racial makeup of the town was 79.1% White, 1.0% African American, 1.3% Hispanic or Latinx, 9.1% Native American, 0.8% Asian, 8.7% from two or more races, and 0.08% from other races. 98.0% of the White populations were of Irish descent.</p><p>The median age in Alvar was 56. 8.0% of residents were under the age of 18; 11.7% were between the ages of 18 and 24; 15.7% were between 25 and 44; 30.1% were from 45 to 64; 34.5% were over the age of 65. The gender ratio of male to female was 636:655, 48.9% male and 51.1% female.</p><p>A total of 107 crimes were documented from 2011 to 2020, of which 93 were physical assaults in the form of bar brawl; 19 were domestic violence, and 7 were motor vehicle theft.</p><h2 id="History"><a href="#History" class="headerlink" title="History"></a>History</h2><p>The area surrounding Alvar Hills was used as part of the hunting grounds for Shawnee Indians until the arrival of 17 Scotch-Irish immigrants led by Aulon Weir in the spring of 1744. Weir allegedly purchased Alvar Hill and its surrounding areas with “a year’s supply of brandy and four barrels of gunpowder along with twenty muskets.” Academics held a skeptical view toward this account for a long time: in 2008, local historian Beatrice McNeal unearthed a Shawnee settlement site a mile west of Alvar, along with 34 charred bodies of various ages dating back to 1700s. The remain of a male body of Irish origin in the center of the explosion suggested that “Alvar was built on lies and blood,” as Dr. McNeal wrote later. The diary of Aulon Weir’s wife, Moira Weir, which was also rediscovered in the Alvar Library in 2008, helped historians confirm Dr. McNeal’s speculation.</p><p>It is widely accepted today that Weir and his company crossed the Appalachian Mountains on March 4, 1744, and settled at the foot of Alvar Hill on on March 11. On March 21, Shawnees returned to the village west of Alvar Hill and hunters discovered Weir’s settlement. The peaceful negotiation for the ownership of the territory lasted for a week and a payment of a year’s supply of brandy and 20 muskets was settled upon for the land up to “a thousand yard [0.944 km] north from the foot of the Hill, totaling 200 acres [0.81 sq km].” The exchange was peacefully made on March 28. On April 3, 1744, Weir wished to make an additional purchase for the hill and the pond at its south. The Shawnee requested four barrels of gunpowder as payment, but only for the right of use. Weir bartered 8 barrels for the ownership, but was rejected. On April 5, 1744, Finnegan Weir, brother of Aulon Weir, entered the Shawnee village to accept the price for usage rights. As the entire village gathered as witnesses, Finnegan Weir revealed his real intent. He pulled out his pair of reading glass before he read the contract, but instead of putting them on, he focused sunlight through them onto the open barrels of gunpowder. Aulon Weir led 5 men after the explosion into the burning village and shot the survivors and the wounded.</p><p>In 1784, Alvar, along with the Ohio Country, became part of the Northwest Territory according to the Treaty of Paris. In 1803, Alvar came under the governance of the newly accepted State of Ohio as part of Washington County, and later became part of Noble County at its establishment in 1851, keeping its municipality and its designation as a “town” (as opposed to the “village” defined in the Ohio Constitution) as part of negotiation by Brendan Weir, the Chair of the Town Council of Alvar and son of Aulon Weir.</p><p>By the 1900s Alvar was well-known as a slow-paced Irish residential town and largely overlooked by outsiders. It wasn’t until the rise of Bennon as a center of education and culture before Alvar came into the public’s (however slight) attention. Due to its proximity to the city and the University of Ohio, Bennon Campus, and its cheap housing rates, a handful of working people moved into the town since 1918. Because of its reputation as an all-Irish settlement, only three African American and five Native American residents were recorded in the 1980 census. With the expansion of the Bennon campus in 1963, Alvar enjoyed a further in-rush of residents with a noticeable increase of people of color.</p><p>On July 4, 1989, a two-people brawl outside the town’s tavern, Shamrock and Eagle, escalated into a six-people shooting gunfight involving three African American college students and three locals of Irish descent. Four were shot dead, and one was heavily wounded and died later in the emergency room. The only survivor, McCoy Lowry, claimed that the initial argument started with his friend Connor Kelleher challenging an African American student’s claims of “American identity”. The 1989 Alvar Tavern Shooting reduced its African American and Native American population by 80%; it has been on the rise again from 2001, and stabilized in 2017. The Asian population also increased slightly, as other villages around Bennon had deeper histories with Asian communities.</p><p>In 2018, <em>Forbes</em> noted that Alvar had the lowest crime rate in the country. A state-wide survey in 2020 found that Alvar had the highest average age in Ohio. Another survey also found that Alvar is popularly known as “that tucked-away village” by the 3% of the Ohio population that were aware of its existence.</p><h2 id="Culture"><a href="#Culture" class="headerlink" title="Culture"></a>Culture</h2><h3 id="Government"><a href="#Government" class="headerlink" title="Government"></a>Government</h3><p>Alvar is governed via a Town Council. The council consists of seven members:</p><ul><li>Chair of the Council</li><li>Chair of Business and Finance<ul><li>Regulation of business ownership and the treasurer</li></ul></li><li>Chair of Communications and Public Relations<ul><li>public relationship with other villages, cities, etc. and oversees media</li></ul></li><li>Chair of Development<ul><li>oversees town development and environmental concerns</li></ul></li><li>Chair of Education and Entertainment<ul><li>in charge of kindergarten and elementary school concerns in Alvar as well as event planning for holidays and festivals</li></ul></li><li>Chair of Jurisdictions (The Grand Judge)<ul><li>oversees the court and town’s rules and regulations</li></ul></li><li>Chair of Public Health and Safety<ul><li>clinics, hospital, and home safety, also the Alvar police force and fire department</li></ul></li></ul><p>Theoretically all seven council members are of equal importance. In practice Chair of the Council is akin to the mayor and more often than not serves as the public spokesperson; Chair of Communications and Public Relations became more or less a minor role in the council in “public relations”. In recent years, however, the Chair of Communications and Public Relations has been making more appearances in public and engaging with nearby villages and city of Bennon officials, promoting more exposure for Alvar.</p><p>All council members are elected to a five-year term by the entire town; only current residents with four or more years of continuous residency in Alvar are eligible to run and be elected for a council position, and only current residents with six or more months of continuous residency in Alvar are allowed to vote.</p><p>While the council makes administrative and legislative decisions of the town, the Committee serves as the bridge between the town residents and the council. It consists of 8 members, each representing two “sectors” (the strip of blocks within two adjacent streets) during committee meetings. Due to the importance and the length of the Main Street, the representation of sectors between East 1st Street and West 1st Street is an exception, as they are represented by two committee members.</p><p>Committee members communicate with residents and business-owners of their respective sectors, passing along important policy drafts and open voting sessions to each block from the council, and issues raised by residents to the council. Committee members are nominated by the residents of the sectors, and are voted upon every two years by both the council and the residents from the sector, who have over three months’ of Alvar residency.</p><p>All members of the council and the Committee are subjected to the “Antidic Rule” (“anti”-“dictation”), which states that, as a collective, Alvar residents have the power to sack immediately any council or Committee member involved in, but not limited to, crime, dictatorship, ill management, or poor health, as long as the threshold of petition is met or exceeded. For council members, the threshold is 45% of the entire Alvar population, regardless of term of residency; for Committee members, the threshold is 25% of the population in the sector represented by the member in question. The “Antidic Rule” was established after the sacking of Aulon Weir and has not invoked since.</p><p>All voting requires proof of legal status in the United States and a minimum age of 14. All positions in the council and the Committee require proof of legal citizenship or permanent residency in the United States, as well as an age of 30 or above.</p><p>Council meetings are held weekly, and the last meeting of every month is open to public in the meeting hall in the Town Hall. Committee meetings with the council are held bi-weekly, and are open to public at all times in the Courthouse.</p><p>Though Alvar has high municipality, the State of Ohio withholds the ultimate right of governance.</p><h3 id="Lifestyle"><a href="#Lifestyle" class="headerlink" title="Lifestyle"></a>Lifestyle</h3><p>Alvarians enjoy a slow-paced and relaxed lifestyle.</p><p>On weekdays, Alvarians commute to work in Bennon mostly by light rail that runs every 15 minutes. Cars, while used, are uncommon because of the lack of easy-to-travel by-roads onto the highway. In the evening, the townspeople either stay at home or visit the local tavern, Shamrock and Eagle. Bedtime is generally 10 p.m. On weekends, Alvarians are accustomed to sleeping in, starting their day after 10 a.m.</p><p>Local business hours run from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. on weekdays and 10:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. on weekends. Due the nature of their business, breakfast cafés run from 7 a.m. to 11 a.m. daily, the tavern opens from 5 p.m. to 11 p.m. from Sunday to Thursday and 5 p.m. to 1 a.m. on weekends, and the tavern-affiliated inn opens from 7 a.m. to midnight, but has personnel at the front desk 24/7.</p><p>Though the Alvarians live up to the hot-tempered (and drunk) Irish stereotype, they are generally open, hospitable, and eager to help. It is an unwritten rule to provide shelter to travelers at night when requested. This is not without precaution, however: everyone is trained in self-defense martial arts from elementary school to middle school since 1939. Residents from outside are also required to participate in a month-long self-defense program when they settle in. In more recent times, travelers to the town are required to present a valid ID that is to be recorded by police night patrols before being taken in. However, this has been rare with the expansion of the town’s inn in 2001.</p><p>Alvarians enjoy gardening and outdoor activities such as hiking, fishing, and hunting. The forest south of Alvar Hill is a popular hunting spot for the townspeople, and Alvar Pond is likewise for trout-fishing. Children in Alvar engage in the parkour tradition from the age of five.</p><h3 id="Landmarks"><a href="#Landmarks" class="headerlink" title="Landmarks"></a>Landmarks</h3><h4 id="The-Olde-Square"><a href="#The-Olde-Square" class="headerlink" title="The Olde Square"></a>The Olde Square</h4><p>The Olde Square is located at the east end of Avenue Road. Three buildings enclose the 2025 square meters of granite-paved clearing: on the south side is the Courthouse; at the east end is the Town Hall; bordering the north side is the Town Archives and Library, which was also the old Alvar church. Although the square and its buildings have undergone three major renovations and restorations in 1844, 1950, and 2011, they retained their rustic and simple style. The 1844 renovation witnessed the fall of Aulon Weir’s statue, and the erection of a sundial in its place. In 1950, the Olde Square’s buildings, along with the rest of Alvar, embraced electricity. This brought about the total renovation of the buildings on the Olde Square to their current looks. The wooden structures were mostly replaced by blocks of granite, the Town Hall was expanded eastwards and a story upwards (totaling two), and the Alvar Church was re-purposed into a full library and archives. Today only the entrance way of the Town Hall remains in its original 1744 wooden construction, together with its thatched roof that is replaced every decade.</p><h4 id="The-Hospital-of-Alvar"><a href="#The-Hospital-of-Alvar" class="headerlink" title="The Hospital of Alvar"></a>The Hospital of Alvar</h4><p>The Hospital of Alvar complex takes up the entire block bordered by four streets and roads; in the clockwise direction, they are: West 2nd Street, Autumn Road, West 1st Street, and Spring Road. The precursor of the complex was the town clinic of Alvar. Built in 1746, the log cabin was renovated into a stone cabin in 1790, and was further expanded in 1840 to accommodate runaway slaves who wandered off the usual Underground Railroad routes. The clinic was later incorporated as a station for slaves en route to Sandusky or Cleveland, and was frequented because of its rather isolated location and the fierceness of the locals against slave catchers. The clinic grew in size during this time as a station and became the Hospital of Alvar in 1856. By the end of the Civil War, the Hospital of Alvar had assisted a total of 534 slaves on their bid for freedom.</p><p>Today the original clinic still stands and opens to Spring Road. It serves both as an urgent care in its east wing and a memorial museum of Alvar’s only involvement in the Civil War in its west wing.</p><h4 id="The-Observatory-Tower"><a href="#The-Observatory-Tower" class="headerlink" title="The Observatory Tower"></a>The Observatory Tower</h4><img src="/2019/01/30/A%20Brief%20Guide%20to%20Alvar/Alvar%20Observatory.jpg" class="" title="The Alvar Observatory"><p>The most prominent structure in Alvar, both in terms of its physical appearance and its mystery, is the observatory tower. Standing 15 meters atop Alvar Hill and measuring 10 meters in diameter, the cylindrical marble tower is wrapped with ivies on the exterior wall and capped by a matte silver metallic dome. The base of the dome is covered by a band of sapphire a meter in width and 30 centimeters in thickness.</p><p>Little about the observatory’s origin can be found in the town records. The earliest mention of the observatory comes from Aulon Weir. On March 30, 1744, Weir wrote in his diary,</p><blockquote><p>The Tower! Such a Structure on the Hill, Walls crawling with dried-up Ivies all around and cracking here and there. Its Windows were the clearest I have ever seen—Finn banged his Head on it when he tried to poke it in and have a Look around. It did not even crack; I swear by God that Finn has the thickest and hardest Head around, and the Ivies shook when he made Contact. Nay, not a hairline Crack. Through the Windows we saw Shelves, all empty. There seemed to be a Statue in there, but the inside was not well-lit despite the windows; we could only see halfway in. Facing the North is a set of Steps leading up to a Gate of black Metal. We saw no Keys nor Keyholes nor any other Mechanisms to open it. Took my trusty Pickaxe to it and bloody Hell, nearly broke my Arms and definitely my Pick. It crumbled against the Gate. Asked the Indians about the Tower. Got their usual Fudge about Gods walking the Earth and peering into the Heavens to return Home. PISH!</p></blockquote><p>On April 1, 1744, Weir wrote again in his diary of the observatory, though briefly,</p><blockquote><p>Some bloody fucking Joke this is. Got a Mallet out of Granite made from the Smithy, and mulled the Window of that blasted Tower. The Mallet <strong><em>shattered</em></strong>. Took the Musket right up against it, and the Barrel exploded like somebody stuffed it. I be the Fool the day I decided to go in. Finn was still obsessed. Fucking Blockhead, should not have listened to him in the first place.</p></blockquote><p>The Alvarian fascination with the observatory lasted only until Aulon Weir’s death in 1783. The mysterious observatory was ignored and avoided for the best part of 120 years until, in 1910, a small group of four historians led by René Luce took an interest in the tower. However, without a way to enter the structure, Luce was only able to record measurements of the exterior and photograph through the windows.</p><p>Luce’s group was closely related to the Alvarian myth that the observatory tower was cursed. On August 13, 1910, the owner of the local inn and tavern, Shamrock and Eagle, found that Luce and his group had disappeared overnight. All of their luggage were left behind except for the black Oxford briefcase Luce always carried around. Nobody reported seeing them leave, and a combing through their belongings by the police found a curious absence of materials related to the observatory. The rumor that the group was “cursed and spirited away” because of their involvement with the observatory tower started spreading and prevailed up to this day, even though it was personally debunked by René Luce and the publication of his 1912 paper on the observatory, <em>La tour curieuse du passé: sur l’Observatoire d’Alvar</em>. Luce’s own account of the “disappearance” was simple. His group was on their last round of photography excursion at the observatory on the night of August 12 when the American photographer Thomas Brown emerged from the woods south of the observatory, and they struck up a conversation. Eventually Brown became intrigued by Luce’s group’s camera. Brown helped Luce and his group take photographs of the observatory, and the latter followed Brown further south to investigate “an Indian ruin [Brown] passed on the way here”. It became the beginning of another investigation of an unknown “trail of tears”. Luce’s group never had an opportunity to return to Alvar for their belongings due to the intensity of their investigation before they had to return to France. “It was lucky that we had our passports and wallets on us at all times when we go on international excursions.” Luce later commented. “We later had our stuff shipped back to us. Cost a fortune, but nothing’s lost.”</p><p>The myth kept people away from the observatory until 2003, when the Alvar-born historian Beatrice McNeal led her team of two historians, one mathematician, one engineer, and one linguist to study the observatory for her doctoral dissertation. McNeal gained entrance of the observatory by reverse-engineering the black gate using ultrasonic and X-ray equipment. The engineer, Buck Hoffmann, disabled the locking mechanism with electromagnetic methods and fixed a mechanical lock and door handle to the gate for future entries. Through radiocarbon dating of the wooden furniture, McNeal estimated the age of the observatory to be 4,000 years old. In 2013 McNeal further assessed the observatory’s age with luminescence dating. She concluded an age of 4,200 years in her 2014 paper.</p><img src="/2019/01/30/A%20Brief%20Guide%20to%20Alvar/Alvar%20Observatory%20rendered.jpg" class="" title="Model of Alvar Observatory as rendered by Dr. Beatrice McNeal"><p>McNeal described the observatory to have three floors: the subfloor, the atrium, and the observatory dome.</p><p>The subfloor is a round library hall measuring 24 meters in diameter and 5 meters in height. It houses 230 redwood bookcases, each with five 40-centimeter tall shelves. It is unknown how the trees or the shelves were transported to the site. The bookcases measure 1.2 meters wide and 30 centimeters deep. Two hundreds of them are arranged into four square sections, five in each row. Two two-meter wide aisle perpendicular to each other separate the four sections. The rest 30 bookcases are lined around the wall with redwood desks and chairs. Two rows of lamp run along the wall at the height of 1.5 meters and 3 meters off the floor, respectively. At the center, where the two aisles cross each other, is an intriguing machine on a three-tiered marble base. The machine resembles a modern computer case attached to a dentist’s chair and a lectern. The casing of the processor tower is made of matte black metal. X-ray failed to penetrate its thick shell. Above the chair is an obsidian half-dome, reaching down from a thick, matte casing that extended from the back of the chair. The lectern is placed under a rod. There is neither an apparent booting method nor any signs of a power source. Directly above the machine is an orb around 1 meter in diameter hanging down from the ceiling, held in place by three interlinked chains. The orb seems to be made of smoky crystal, and disperses light around the subfloor when shone upon. On the wall to the south is another black gate. The gate is arched at the top, measuring two meters wide and three meters tall. Patterns are engraved on its surface, originating from a ring pattern 2 meters above the floor, splitting into two main paths, branching and curving their ways downward into the ground. Dr. McNeal failed to reverse engineer the gate, as it is impregnable by X-ray or ultrasound.</p><p>The atrium on the first floor is dim despite the tall and wide windows along the wall. Each window sits 50 centimeters above the ground, towering 3 meters high and ranging from 2 meters to 4 meters wide. Once unlatched, the windows can be either pushed open or slid into the gaps between the double-layered tower wall. When pushed open, the window panes can refract light into the interior and brighten up the room considerably. The exterior and the interior wall layers are 70 centimeters and 20 centimeters thick, respectively. X-ray analysis revealed a curious structural design in the ten-centimeter gap between the exterior and interior walls: slabs of additional marble are placed in the gaps to form intersecting channels throughout. Dr. McNeal speculates that these structures served as pipes that are absent: had the observatory a heating or a cooling system, the air or water could move through the wall for high regulation efficiency.</p><p>The first floor also contains bookshelves, lamps, and desks like the subfloor library. The statue in the center that was observed in Weir’s diary is pristine and accumulated no dust to date. It is intricately sculpted out of white marble, depicting a long-haired young king with sharp features and rather pointed ears hidden beneath the sculpted hair. Its eyes are set with sapphire. The writing on the base it stands on bears a plaque, and the writing upon is fiery and indecipherable. A map of parchment, 2 meters by 2 meters, hangs on the southeast section of the wall near the stairs up. It is annotated in the fiery writing as well as showing unfamiliar landscapes. Scholars debated its authenticity, some comparing it to the <em>Voynich Manuscript</em> while others claimed it merely shows an older landscape of the local area, pointing to a section recognized by many as the Alvar Pond, citing its larger area, its different southern shoreline, and the depiction of a river that now runs underground.</p><p>The second floor is the observatory dome, 10 meters in height from the floor to the apex of the silver dome. On the west section of the wall is a set of steps leading to a platform 2.5 meters wide and 2 meters above the floor. Below it are four more bookcases. The platform runs for 3 meters along the wall, its edge marked with crystal panels set in rails.  At its end are more curious machines with metal casings like the one in the subfloor library, but these have smaller processing cases. Columns raising from the processing cases support several sloped control panels with buttons, switches, and levers presumably to control the telescope. An obsidian slab is raised behind the control panels as though a screen. Again, as with the machine in the subfloor library, the control apparatus cannot be activated or scanned for interior design.</p><p>The telescope in the center of the room is supported by a mobile, circular base. The base has six granite wheels around its circumference, all one-meter in diameter, double-layered, and 25 centimeters thick per layer, a total of 60 centimeters thick. The wheels run in 62-centimeter wide grooves in the floor, presumably in both directions to rotate the telescope. The base of the telescope has a diameter of 3 meters. The lens of the telescope is 5 meters long with a pitching angle from 20&deg; to 70&deg;. The eyepiece is 10 centimeters in diameter and the objective is 1.2 meters. X-ray unraveled a complex diffraction and reflection mechanism within the lens, which provides a calculated focal length of 20 meters. Another black metal box was discovered in the column supporting the lens with filaments resembling wires connecting it to the objective lens. Combined with hairline filaments crisscrossing the objective lens, it is speculated that the telescope is able to perform imaging through mechanisms other than mere optical imaging.</p><p>A set of steps on the east side of the base lead up to the stone seat in front of the eyepiece. A small obsidian slab raises up and forward from the right armrest of the seat. The slab’s position is adjustable.</p><p>There are also 12 granite wheels along the base of the dome. These wheels run on track rails, and are also double-layered, but with a longer axle compared to the wheels of the telescope. Each axle connects the outer double wheel and the inner double wheel. The bottom of the dome has grooves for the axles to settle in. The sapphire band outside bends backward at its top and fits into the gap between the layers of the outer wheel, locking itself securely with the dome and alleviates the mechanical stress the band might be under; with the protruding tracks the outer wheel runs on, the sapphire band also locks the wheels into place, which secures, in turn, the dome. The wheels can rotate the dome in both directions.</p><p>The wall of the second floor bears 9 smaller windows, 1.5 meters tall and 1 meter wide, making the hall even more dim than the floor below. However, all of these windows can be moved like those in the atrium, and bring in light from outside to great effect. Additionally, several movable slabs of metal on the dome seem to serve as windows when more daylight is needed. These can be pushed open quite easily, as long as one is able to reach them; however, situated at least 7 meters off the ground, it will be no small task. A larger slab of metal that acts as the skylight for the telescope is also on the dome. No powered mechanisms of control of any kind was found. Historians and researchers have not succeeded in operating the telescope, or any part of the observatory, except for the front gate.</p><p>In addition to the power source, despite the total 240 bookcases found in the tower, not a single scroll, tome, book, or text collections or information containers of any known kind was found other than the plaque on the statue and the map. The materials found so far are insufficient to reveal concrete information of the observatory’s origin. Due to its unique design and lack of reliable historical records, no realistic theory is proposed publicly on the subject. Dr. McNeal, the historian most involved in the research of the observatory, commented,</p><blockquote><p>“The joke within our circle, of course, is that the tower was built aliens stranded on Earth to find a way home. Believe or not, this joke is more readily accepted than the theory saying it’s a practical joke by the Weir Family. Looking at the aesthetic style of the tower, the outlandish design of the mechanisms of the door and the telescope, the advanced and, seriously, <em>alien</em> technology, ya’ know, involved in the entire building process, and the fact that the tower has no power source found yet everything within demands a power source to function—oh not to mention that Indian myth Weir reported in his diary—it is too hard <em>not</em> to think of extra-terrestrials, ya’ know? Oh, have I mentioned that my linguist friend on my team told us that the language system on the map and the plaque is <em>nothing</em> like any language we have on Earth, be it natural or artificial? But it bares unmistakable signs of a natural language, ya’ know? Of course, no—I’m more inclined to the theory that a more technologically advanced ancient civilization built this. <em>That</em> is probably the most logical answer here. Too bad I’m not allowed to dig under my town for more, ya’ know? Too bad there are talks in the council about razing this thing down for a highway by-road. They’ve want a proper road to Highway 77 for ages, ya’ know, more convenient access to Bennon. Of course I could just throw the ancient civ theory out at them, but if <em>you</em> are the decision-makers, would <em>you</em> buy it?”</p></blockquote><h3 id="Architecture"><a href="#Architecture" class="headerlink" title="Architecture"></a>Architecture</h3><p>The first Alvarian houses were log cabins with traditional Irish thatched roof because of a lack of stone resource in the area. Later the entire town of Alvar underwent two large-scale renovations: one in 1844, shortly after the installment of the first steam-powered railway system; another in 1950, with the introduction of affordable electricity.</p><p>The 1844 renovation was a facelift for Alvar. The newly built train station and the railway connected Alvar with the then-growing village of Bennon, providing more robust commercial trade with the outside world. The railway also brought in aesthetics and practices prevalent of the time. Soon the modernization began, first with architecture. Stone blocks for construction were imported for the first time, through the railway. The traditional sharp-angled thatched roof and hemp-tied log cabins were replaced by the more fireproof, tiled roofs and stone walls. The fire pits in the center of each log cabin evolved into stone fireplaces in the back of the living room. The dirt roads became paved. The town was also able to expand and established the convention of “streets” and “roads”.</p><p>The 1950 renovation brought Alvar more up-to-date systems, such as electricity, tap water system, proper drainage, town-wide heating system, and updates to the architecture that remain to this day. All new systems run underground, including electricity and telephone cables, and the later optical fibers.</p><p>Houses in Alvar today are built of stone bricks and are painted gray, white, or yellow. The houses are traditionally low, with no elevated front porches, and no more than two stories high. The first story is dug into the ground; upon entering the front door, there will always be two steps down. The houses have basements but no attics. Each house has either one or two chimneys. Since 1950, the roofs are covered in thicker black or red tiles than the ones used in 1844, and are striated with ridges that can guide rainwater to either side. The slope of the roofs also became much more flat in the 1950 renovation, angling between 15&deg; to 20&deg; downward. Roofs cover not only the second story but also the protruding first story in the front and back, as well as the side without a chimney, giving the houses a tiered appearance. The lower roofs generally extends 1 meter from the wall, and the upper roofs are much shorter, usually 15 to 20 centimeters. Gardens are surrounded with low walls 1 meter tall and 30 centimeters wide, leaving a gap for the entrance way. The size of the houses and the gardens vary from household to household, but because of the road layout, the backyards are generally a less-than-one-meter wide strip half covered by the lower roof.</p><p>One unique structure of Alvarian architecture that can be seen frequently in the town is the roof bridges. First conceived during the 1844 renovation and became more and more widely accepted after 1950, the roof bridges connect the second stories of the two houses on the opposite sides of a street of a road. These bridges are 2 meters wide and are supported by a long arch. Roofs of both houses extend to cover the bridge. In the case which the two roofs are not in the same color, usually the tile color of the bridge is a mix of the two depending on the two households.</p><p>The roof bridges were intended as emergency escape routes. At either end of the bridge is a fireproof door that the house owners have keys to. The corridor has two windows on either side of the wall, and a trapdoor in the ceiling in the middle of the bridge. Each roof bridge is equipped with heavy-duty rope ladders under the low interior windowsills, in addition to fire extinguishers, bulletproof vests, tear spray, and emergency hammers. In emergencies residents can escape through windows onto the ground or the trapdoor onto the roof if needed. All roof bridges and their equipment are checked twice every year by the fire department.</p><p>Roof bridges are considered a defining symbol of Alvar. There are 70 roof bridges in total, and most of them are within East and West 3rd Streets, but a handful of them can also be seen in the more recent expansions of the town outside the two streets.</p><h3 id="Parkour"><a href="#Parkour" class="headerlink" title="Parkour"></a>Parkour</h3><p>Visitors of Alvar, be it tourists or hunters seeking a quiet fishing or hunting spot in fall, or hikers emerging from the trails in the Alvar Woods, or students of the University attracted by low rents, never fail to be astonished by the sight of children sprinting and leaping on top of the houses when they first arrive in Alvar. If they asked a child where he or she hang out in free time, the answer would always be, “the roof tops!” as it has been for the past eight decades. Thus is the one-of-a-kind underage parkour culture in Alvar, thanks to the town’s landscape and layout. </p><p>Unlike the world outside, parkour activities are limited only to children in Alvar. What is more, the activity is sanctioned, and even encouraged. Children of Alvar are characteristically agile, and start parkour as early as at the age of five. Young children learn the activity through older children. The first steps begin with climbing onto the low garden walls and learning how to balance, and followed by running and skipping on the lower roofs. At the age of six the children can climb onto the lower roofs by leaping from the side or the back garden wall. An average eight-year-old Alvarian child is able to freerun around the roofs in his or her block and, with the help of roof bridges, perhaps those in the neighboring blocks. A ten-year-old can freerun throughout the town.</p><p>The usual route of parkour starts with scaling up to the lower roof either by leaping and grabbing from the side or the back garden wall or from the second-floor windows. From here, the lower roofs provide a runway along the road (interspersed with garden walls and trees). The upper roofs are reached only by scaling the walls. From the upper roof, the child can reach the lower roof of the adjacent house south by jumping down; ambitious children are able to do so via the lower roofs as well, thanks to the close height difference and the gap between the two lower roofs. Because of the distance and height, roads and streets are crossed only via the roof bridges, or at the end of the roads where roofs are closer together. Very rarely a child can be seen to cross via strong trees. This stunt often ends in a trip to the urgent care.</p><p>It is unclear how the culture started or why it is pertained to children. The first evidence of this activity was from a travel log in the early 1950s, and scholars believed that the sturdier structures and the ridged tiles brought about by the 1950 renovation paved the way for the beginning of this tradition. Anthropologist Trevor Murphy, an Alvar local himself, agrees to this view and points out that photographs of Alvar by Thomas Brown, who returned to Alvar multiple times in his life up to his death in 1968, provide indirect support. In photographs from 1946, the roof tops are still bare. In a photograph from 1954, however, a group of young men and women above twenty can be seen leaning against a chimney while two children run across a roof bridge. Brown was known to be particularly fond of the photograph of a young woman leaping over a gap to the roof he was standing on, taken from the same period. Murphy also found mentions of parkour activity in diaries of grownups at the time. These mentions, however, ceased after 1960. A later collaboration paper between McNeal and Murphy in 2011 contained an economical explanation to this phenomenon. The roofs can support a combined weight of no more than three adults before the tiles break. This means that prolonged running and leaping activities from adults will wear down the tiles faster, causing a sizable amount of repair cost. Children, on the other hand, will cause much less damage because of their size, especially when taken into account that children of Alvar are rarely overweight because of their lifestyle. Indeed, in 1959, the year of the state-wide flood in Ohio, repair cost for the roofs dropped by 85%, merely because the majority of the adult population in Alvar spent an entire year joining the post-flood reconstruction efforts in the nearby village, Howard, and did not engage in parkour activities. The continuously low roof repair costs seems to indicate that the adults dropped the activity since then. Murphy further commented in the paper,</p><blockquote><p>From my own personal experiences, most of the children parkoured less and less at the age of 15. It is no coincidence, I think, that this is also the age at which they prepare for high schools. Alvar itself no longer has a local high school, and children have to attend out of town. A lot of their choices are boarding schools as well, and some children, like I was, come home only once a month. This, together with the increased schoolwork, cut down the time they can parkour. As their teenage bodies mature, they realize themselves as well that if they continue to parkour, they will not only be putting their safety at risk, but also that of the roofs.</p></blockquote><p>As for the concerns of safety, both McNeal and Murphy suggest that it is minor. In their survey for the 2011 paper, 96% of adults local to Alvar (both born in the town and residents of over five years) reported that they would worry more if their children does <em>not</em> join in the parkour culture. Top concerns for this include potential health issues (the child might have ailments preventing him or her from freerunning or he or she might not get enough exercise) and bullying behavior (the child might be bullied by others or he or she might be unpopular). This, however, does not mean safety is not on the minds of the parents, as their paper stated,</p><blockquote><p>The initiation to the activity is always done by the parents. A common exchange between young children around five is, “did your ma/pa put you on the wall yet?” The phrase “put on the wall” means the initiation, in which the parent puts the child onto the garden wall, letting the child walk along while holding his or her hands, and helping the child find the way down. During the first weeks, the parents will repeatedly recite safety rules to the child before he or she gets on the wall: “Always watch your steps; never parkour after sundown; never make a jump without complete confidence; never jump down from upper roofs; never run over streets or roads when cars are driving past; never run across the Main Street; never cross streets or roads from trees.” Peer supervision also adds another layer of safety. Children stopping each other from dangerous stunts are uncommon but also not rare. The town also imposes a ban on parkour after 5 p.m. all year long. Police night patrol will be out at this time, and will ask children to get down. To our knowledge there is yet to be a case of disobedience.</p></blockquote><p>Occasionally deaths and injuries will occur. There is a total of 22 injuries and one death from 2010 to 2020.</p>]]></content>
