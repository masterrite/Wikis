I am Billy Liu, a Chinese native who's studying biology and English in the States. I've been writing since the age of 6, and currently (2019) I'm working in a lab in the U of U, studying chromosome conformations during meiosis.

This is my place to put down background stories for my stories - a "wiki" for all of my ideas and researches and thoughts, and a reference point for me when I write my stories. So far, I have little to put down, but in the future I will be putting a lot of things in here. I'm hoping that this place will be in a good shape in 2030. I will not be putting my stories up here, however - this place is strictly a database.

I write fiction stories and sometimes poems. For those, please visit [blockandpen.wordpress.com](blockandpen.wordpress.com "Writers Around the Block"), or, if you have WeChat, search and follow: WritersAroundTheBlock.
