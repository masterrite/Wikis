                        <p>Before us is a door, and beyond that, the stage. On the stage is the dark red velvet curtain pulled shut, and on the other side, we know, is whatever is out there. I stand beside Mae in her chair. She seems to be chewing her lips.</p>
<p>"It'll be the time soon." I say to her. "Are you alright?"</p>
<p>"Not really." She turns to me, big green eyes full of anxiety. "Do I look appropriate?" She's in a white cashmere sweater and white woolen dress. She sits on the cushioned chair with only the pointed toes of her brown semi-combat boots touching the floor. She hates heels so there aren't any. I knew Ryan would puff out his chest and say, "She picked out everything herself!" Indeed she did. Her flame-red hair is tied, not in the hair bun her mother forces to wear all the time, but the crown braid the Lius fixed for her, which she loves.</p>

Wading through the chattering crowd with an empty stomach, only to find a rather cramped table for four in a corner is <em>not</em> her ideal first day of senior year in middle school. Her friends nod in agreement. "I wish it's still summer."</p>
<p>"Definitely not ready for school, no." Julia pulls an extra chair over.</p>
<p>"No kidding." Landon comes over with a slice of cheese cake, four cupcakes, and two big chunks of brownie. He hands on brownie to Max and tries to stuff the other into Julia's mouth, and gives the cupcake plate to Lily and Mae. "I guess especially you, Mae, since you missed most of it in the Treasure Trove."</p>

                        <p>"Do you think he'll be home when we get back?" Lindsay asks behind the wheels. Cars glide through the streets of Kanten Av Skogen before her in the long Scandinavian winter night, the noise of their engines muffled by the thin mist flooding the town. Early Scandinavian winter brings an early evening; only a layer of glass keeps the chill at bay.</p>
<p>"He will. Don't worry. Charlie always comes back from his wanderings before six. He's smart even for a dog." William soothes her.</p>

                        <p>Lao Wang woke to an infant dawn, hiding behind the curtains. Light snuck its way onto his wrinkled face through the gap, which he turned to his decade-old alarm clock first, then to the curtains, and finally to the metal heater at the foot of his bed. Dressing took him less than ten minutes: after his wife passed away almost two years ago, he had kept his clothes on the empty side of the bed instead of on the heater—a mere substitute of what was lost, even if it meant for him starting his winter days cold.</p>
<p>For the past two weeks, Lao Wang has broken out of his morning routine of curtains, bathroom, wash, and breakfast. He went straight to the foot of his bed, and squatted down to stroke Coco, his Chinese rural dog. The mud-yellow fur was stiff and the body was lukewarm. She slept on her side in the many-layered nest, breathing way too shallow for Lao Wang's liking. Coco hadn't moved much for two weeks and Lao Wang felt that it would be any day now. He went to pour milk into one of her bowls and filled up the other with chow.</p>

<p>　　“他们能听懂我说的话吗？”艾瑞思四下看了看。海关大厅里挤满了人。大厅宽大明亮，人山人海。防护带把大厅一分为二，一边挤满了人，另一边被更多防护带围成了迷宫，两条队伍在里面缓布前行，围着一根柱子绕了一圈又一圈。柱子上的电视屏幕播放着一遍又一遍“准备好您的护照”和“如果您有需要申报的物品”之类的话。</p>

<p>"Would they understand me?" Iris looked around. The customs was full of people: in the expansive, brightly-lit hall, a sea of black-haired people milled about. A row of belts separated it in half. On one side was the open space, and on the other, a labyrinth of more belt fences. Two long lines snaked through this maze. They went around and around the passage, around pillars, upon which the TV screens showed the usual "prepare your passport" and "if you have items to declare".</p>

                        <p>The city looks adorable after snow, he thought, especially around Christmas. The yellow lights and grey wires were draped with tiny icicles from melted and refrozen snow. They ran along the street, above the Christmas shoppers' heads, through the bare branches of trees, swaying a little in the chilly December wind, and nodded at the other colorful lights—LCD and LED and neon—their brethren in the windows of various shops packed with customers. These merry lights raced each other on both sides of the street, curling into outlines of angels at each lamp posts, and converged into a big four-pointed star at a crossroad far ahead. "Hey Iris, look!" He pointed at the converge-point to the girl walking beside him, a leash with a golden retriever at its end in hand. Some designer apparently thought it a cute idea to hang also a wreath of mistletoe under the star, as if there would be anyone to stand under there. "Isn't that weird?" A faint smile played around the girl's pink lips.</p>

                        <p>冬至悄悄来临，脚步轻盈。今天是一年中白天最短的一天，而我们所在的地方又更靠北一些，所以白天的时间变得弥足珍贵。</p>
<p>老纳尔早早就把艾瑞思和我叫了回来——简直是太早。</p>
<p>“大黑天没啥猎物可打，也没啥好玩的，我敢肯定你们领教过这儿天黑后的厉害。快进来啊，让我们像这里淳朴的北方居民那样来度过这个夜晚。他们有个老传统，冬至和圣诞节时，大家都围在炉火旁，每人捧着一杯热茶或热可可，一起讲故事、玩儿个尽兴。”</p>
<p>“像一家人一样。”艾瑞思接道。</p>
<p>“哎对，就像一家人一样。”纳尔点点头。</p>

                        <p>Winter solstice came upon us in tiny cat's feet. This is the shortest day on Earth, and since we were so high up to the north, the daylight was especially scarce.</p>
<p>Old Nar' called Iris and me in early - much earlier.</p>
<p>“There is no good hunting or playing in the dark. I am sure you have experienced the harshness once the night falls. Come on in, and let us observe an old tradition the honest inhabitants here up north keep. We gather around the merry fire, and each grab a cup of tea. Then, we share stories and have a good time.”</p>
<p>“Just like a family.” Iris added.</p>
<p>“Aye, just like a family.” Nar' agreed.</p>
